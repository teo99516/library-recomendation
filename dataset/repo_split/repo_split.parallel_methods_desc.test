DCNL If DynamoDB returns any unprocessed items, you should retry DCNL the batch operation on those items. However, we strongly DCNL recommend that you use an exponential backoff algorithm . If DCNL you retry the batch operation immediately, the underlying read DCNL or write requests can still fail due to throttling on the DCNL individual tables. If you delay the batch operation using DCNL exponential backoff, the individual requests in the batch are DCNL much more likely to succeed. DCNL For more information, go to `Batch Operations and Error DCNL Handling`_ in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide . DCNL By default, BatchGetItem performs eventually consistent reads DCNL on every table in the request. If you want strongly consistent DCNL reads instead, you can set ConsistentRead to `True` for any or DCNL all tables. DCNL In order to minimize response latency, BatchGetItem retrieves DCNL items in parallel. DCNL When designing your application, keep in mind that DynamoDB DCNL does not return attributes in any particular order. To help DCNL parse the response by item, include the primary key values for DCNL the items in your request in the AttributesToGet parameter. DCNL If a requested item does not exist, it is not returned in the DCNL result. Requests for nonexistent items consume the minimum DCNL read capacity units according to the type of read. For more DCNL information, see `Capacity Units Calculations`_ in the Amazon DCNL DynamoDB Developer Guide . DCNL :type request_items: map DCNL :param request_items: DCNL A map of one or more table names and, for each table, the corresponding DCNL primary keys for the items to retrieve. Each table name can be DCNL invoked only once. DCNL Each element in the map consists of the following: DCNL + Keys - An array of primary key attribute values that define specific DCNL items in the table. For each primary key, you must provide all of DCNL the key attributes. For example, with a hash type primary key, you DCNL only need to specify the hash attribute. For a hash-and-range type DCNL primary key, you must specify both the hash attribute and the range DCNL attribute. DCNL + AttributesToGet - One or more attributes to be retrieved from the DCNL table. By default, all attributes are returned. If a specified DCNL attribute is not found, it does not appear in the result. Note that DCNL AttributesToGet has no effect on provisioned throughput DCNL consumption. DynamoDB determines capacity units consumed based on DCNL item size, not on the amount of data that is returned to an DCNL application. DCNL + ConsistentRead - If `True`, a strongly consistent read is used; if DCNL `False` (the default), an eventually consistent read is used. DCNL :type return_consumed_capacity: string DCNL :param return_consumed_capacity: A value that if set to `TOTAL`, the DCNL response includes ConsumedCapacity data for tables and indexes. If DCNL set to `INDEXES`, the response includes ConsumedCapacity for DCNL indexes. If set to `NONE` (the default), ConsumedCapacity is not DCNL included in the response.'
'The BatchWriteItem operation puts or deletes multiple items in DCNL one or more tables. A single call to BatchWriteItem can write DCNL up to 16 MB of data, which can comprise as many as 25 put or DCNL delete requests. Individual items to be written can be as DCNL large as 400 KB. DCNL BatchWriteItem cannot update items. To update items, use the DCNL UpdateItem API. DCNL The individual PutItem and DeleteItem operations specified in DCNL BatchWriteItem are atomic; however BatchWriteItem as a whole DCNL is not. If any requested operations fail because the table\'s DCNL provisioned throughput is exceeded or an internal processing DCNL failure occurs, the failed operations are returned in the DCNL UnprocessedItems response parameter. You can investigate and DCNL optionally resend the requests. Typically, you would call DCNL BatchWriteItem in a loop. Each iteration would check for DCNL unprocessed items and submit a new BatchWriteItem request with DCNL those unprocessed items until all items have been processed. DCNL Note that if none of the items can be processed due to DCNL insufficient provisioned throughput on all of the tables in DCNL the request, then BatchWriteItem will return a DCNL ProvisionedThroughputExceededException . DCNL If DynamoDB returns any unprocessed items, you should retry DCNL the batch operation on those items. However, we strongly DCNL recommend that you use an exponential backoff algorithm . If DCNL you retry the batch operation immediately, the underlying read DCNL or write requests can still fail due to throttling on the DCNL individual tables. If you delay the batch operation using DCNL exponential backoff, the individual requests in the batch are DCNL much more likely to succeed. DCNL For more information, go to `Batch Operations and Error DCNL Handling`_ in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide . DCNL With BatchWriteItem , you can efficiently write or delete DCNL large amounts of data, such as from Amazon Elastic MapReduce DCNL (EMR), or copy data from another database into DynamoDB. In DCNL order to improve performance with these large-scale DCNL operations, BatchWriteItem does not behave in the same way as DCNL individual PutItem and DeleteItem calls would For example, you DCNL cannot specify conditions on individual put and delete DCNL requests, and BatchWriteItem does not return deleted items in DCNL the response. DCNL If you use a programming language that supports concurrency, DCNL such as Java, you can use threads to write items in parallel. DCNL Your application must include the necessary logic to manage DCNL the threads. With languages that don\'t support threading, such DCNL as PHP, you must update or delete the specified items one at a DCNL time. In both situations, BatchWriteItem provides an DCNL alternative where the API performs the specified put and DCNL delete operations in parallel, giving you the power of the DCNL thread pool approach without having to introduce complexity DCNL into your application. DCNL Parallel processing reduces latency, but each specified put DCNL and delete request consumes the same number of write capacity DCNL units whether it is processed in parallel or not. Delete DCNL operations on nonexistent items consume one write capacity DCNL unit. DCNL If one or more of the following is true, DynamoDB rejects the DCNL entire batch write operation: DCNL + One or more tables specified in the BatchWriteItem request DCNL does not exist. DCNL + Primary key attributes specified on an item in the request DCNL do not match those in the corresponding table\'s primary key DCNL schema. DCNL + You try to perform multiple operations on the same item in DCNL the same BatchWriteItem request. For example, you cannot put DCNL and delete the same item in the same BatchWriteItem request. DCNL + There are more than 25 requests in the batch. DCNL + Any individual item in a batch exceeds 400 KB. DCNL + The total request size exceeds 16 MB. DCNL :type request_items: map DCNL :param request_items: DCNL A map of one or more table names and, for each table, a list of DCNL operations to be performed ( DeleteRequest or PutRequest ). Each DCNL element in the map consists of the following: DCNL + DeleteRequest - Perform a DeleteItem operation on the specified item. DCNL The item to be deleted is identified by a Key subelement: DCNL + Key - A map of primary key attribute values that uniquely identify DCNL the ! item. Each entry in this map consists of an attribute name DCNL and an attribute value. For each primary key, you must provide all DCNL of the key attributes. For example, with a hash type primary key, DCNL you only need to specify the hash attribute. For a hash-and-range DCNL type primary key, you must specify both the hash attribute and the DCNL range attribute. DCNL + PutRequest - Perform a PutItem operation on the specified item. The DCNL item to be put is identified by an Item subelement: DCNL + Item - A map of attributes and their values. Each entry in this map DCNL consists of an attribute name and an attribute value. Attribute DCNL values must not be null; string and binary type attributes must DCNL have lengths greater than zero; and set type attributes must not be DCNL empty. Requests that contain empty values will be rejected with a DCNL ValidationException exception. If you specify any attributes that DCNL are part of an index key, then the data types for those attributes DCNL must match those of the schema in the table\'s attribute definition. DCNL :type return_consumed_capacity: string DCNL :param return_consumed_capacity: A value that if set to `TOTAL`, the DCNL response includes ConsumedCapacity data for tables and indexes. If DCNL set to `INDEXES`, the response includes ConsumedCapacity for DCNL indexes. If set to `NONE` (the default), ConsumedCapacity is not DCNL included in the response. DCNL :type return_item_collection_metrics: string DCNL :param return_item_collection_metrics: A value that if set to `SIZE`, DCNL the response includes statistics about item collections, if any, DCNL that were modified during the operation are returned in the DCNL response. If set to `NONE` (the default), no statistics are DCNL returned.'
'The CreateTable operation adds a new table to your account. In DCNL an AWS account, table names must be unique within each region. DCNL That is, you can have two tables with same name if you create DCNL the tables in different regions. DCNL CreateTable is an asynchronous operation. Upon receiving a DCNL CreateTable request, DynamoDB immediately returns a response DCNL with a TableStatus of `CREATING`. After the table is created, DCNL DynamoDB sets the TableStatus to `ACTIVE`. You can perform DCNL read and write operations only on an `ACTIVE` table. DCNL You can optionally define secondary indexes on the new table, DCNL as part of the CreateTable operation. If you want to create DCNL multiple tables with secondary indexes on them, you must DCNL create the tables sequentially. Only one table with secondary DCNL indexes can be in the `CREATING` state at any given time. DCNL You can use the DescribeTable API to check the table status. DCNL :type attribute_definitions: list DCNL :param attribute_definitions: An array of attributes that describe the DCNL key schema for the table and indexes. DCNL :type table_name: string DCNL :param table_name: The name of the table to create. DCNL :type key_schema: list DCNL :param key_schema: Specifies the attributes that make up the primary DCNL key for a table or an index.

DCNL Each KeySchemaElement in the array is composed of: DCNL + AttributeName - The name of this key attribute. DCNL + KeyType - Determines whether the key attribute is `HASH` or `RANGE`. DCNL For a primary key that consists of a hash attribute, you must specify DCNL exactly one element with a KeyType of `HASH`. DCNL For a primary key that consists of hash and range attributes, you must DCNL specify exactly two elements, in this order: The first element must DCNL have a KeyType of `HASH`, and the second element must have a DCNL KeyType of `RANGE`. DCNL For more information, see `Specifying the Primary Key`_ in the Amazon DCNL DynamoDB Developer Guide . DCNL :type local_secondary_indexes: list DCNL :param local_secondary_indexes: DCNL One or more local secondary indexes (the maximum is five) to be created DCNL on the table. Each index is scoped to a given hash key value. There DCNL is a 10 GB size limit per hash key; otherwise, the size of a local DCNL secondary index is unconstrained. DCNL Each local secondary index in the array includes the following: DCNL + IndexName - The name of the local secondary index. Must be unique DCNL only for this table. DCNL + KeySchema - Specifies the key schema for the local secondary index. DCNL The key schema must begin with the same hash key attribute as the DCNL table. DCNL + Projection - Specifies attributes that are copied (projected) from DCNL the table into the index. These are in addition to the primary key DCNL attributes and index key attributes, which are automatically DCNL projected. Each attribute specification is composed of: DCNL + ProjectionType - One of the following: DCNL + `KEYS_ONLY` - Only the index and primary keys are projected into the DCNL index. DCNL + `INCLUDE` - Only the specified table attributes are projected into DCNL the index. The list of projected attributes are in NonKeyAttributes DCNL + `ALL` - All of the table attributes are projected into the index. DCNL + NonKeyAttributes - A list of one or more non-key attribute names that DCNL are projected into the secondary index. The total count of DCNL attributes specified in NonKeyAttributes , summed across all of the DCNL secondary indexes, must not exceed 20. If you project the same DCNL attribute into two different indexes, this counts as two distinct DCNL attributes when determining the total. DCNL :type global_secondary_indexes: list DCNL :param global_secondary_indexes: DCNL One or more global secondary indexes (the maximum is five) to be DCNL created on the table. Each global secondary index in the array DCNL includes the following: DCNL + IndexName - The name of the global secondary index. Must be unique DCNL only for this table. DCNL + KeySchema - Specifies the key schema for the global secondary index. DCNL + Projection - Specifies attributes that are copied (projected) from DCNL the table into the index. These are in addition to the primary key DCNL attributes and index key attributes, which are automatically DCNL projected. Each attribute specification is composed of: DCNL + ProjectionType - One of the following: DCNL + `KEYS_ONLY` - Only the index and primary keys are projected into the DCNL index.

'Deletes a single item in a table by primary key. You can DCNL perform a conditional delete operation that deletes the item DCNL if it exists, or if it has an expected attribute value. DCNL In addition to deleting an item, you can also return the DCNL item\'s attribute values in the same operation, using the DCNL ReturnValues parameter. DCNL Unless you specify conditions, the DeleteItem is an idempotent DCNL operation; running it multiple times on the same item or DCNL attribute does not result in an error response. DCNL Conditional deletes are useful for deleting items only if DCNL specific conditions are met. If those conditions are met, DCNL DynamoDB performs the delete. Otherwise, the item is not DCNL deleted. DCNL :type table_name: string DCNL :param table_name: The name of the table from which to delete the item. DCNL :type key: map DCNL :param key: A map of attribute names to AttributeValue objects, DCNL representing the primary key of the item to delete. DCNL For the primary key, you must provide all of the attributes. For DCNL example, with a hash type primary key, you only need to specify the DCNL hash attribute. For a hash-and-range type primary key, you must DCNL specify both the hash attribute and the range attribute. DCNL :type expected: map DCNL :param expected: DCNL There is a newer parameter available. Use ConditionExpression instead. DCNL Note that if you use Expected and ConditionExpression at the same DCNL time, DynamoDB will return a ValidationException exception. DCNL This parameter does not support lists or maps. DCNL A map of attribute/condition pairs. Expected provides a conditional DCNL block for the DeleteItem operation. DCNL Each element of Expected consists of an attribute name, a comparison DCNL operator, and one or more values. DynamoDB compares the attribute DCNL with the value(s) you supplied, using the comparison operator. For DCNL each Expected element, the result of the evaluation is either true DCNL or false. DCNL If you specify more than one element in the Expected map, then by DCNL default all of the conditions must evaluate to true. In other DCNL words, the conditions are ANDed together. (You can use the DCNL ConditionalOperator parameter to OR the conditions instead. If you DCNL do this, then at least one of the conditions must evaluate to true, DCNL rather than all of them.) DCNL If the Expected map evaluates to true, then the conditional operation DCNL succeeds; otherwise, it fails. DCNL Expected contains the following: DCNL + AttributeValueList - One or more values to evaluate against the DCNL supplied attribute. The number of values in the list depends on the DCNL ComparisonOperator being used. For type Number, value comparisons DCNL are numeric. String value comparisons for greater than, equals, or DCNL less than are based on ASCII character code values. For example, DCNL `a` is greater than `A`, and `a` is greater than `B`. For a list of DCNL code values, see DCNL `http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#ASCII_printable_characters`_. DCNL For type Binary, DynamoDB treats each byte of the binary data as DCNL unsigned when it compares binary values, for example when DCNL evaluating query expressions. DCNL + ComparisonOperator - A comparator for evaluating attributes in the DCNL AttributeValueList . When performing the comparison, DynamoDB uses DCNL strongly consistent reads. The following comparison operators are DCNL available: `EQ | NE | LE | LT | GE | GT | NOT_NULL | NULL | DCNL CONTAINS | NOT_CONTAINS | BEGINS_WITH | IN | BETWEEN` The following DCNL are descriptions of each comparison operator. DCNL + `EQ` : Equal. `EQ` is supported for all datatypes, including lists DCNL and maps. AttributeValueList can contain only one AttributeValue DCNL element of type String, Number, Binary, String Set, Number Set, or DCNL Binary Set. If an item contains an AttributeValue element of a DCNL different type than the one specified in the request, the value DCNL does not match. For example, `{"S":"6"}` does not equal DCNL `{"N":"6"}`. Also, `{"N":"6"}` does not equal `{"NS":["6", "2", DCNL "1"]}`. > <li> DCNL + `NE` : Not equal. `NE` is supported for all datatypes, including DCNL lists and maps. AttributeValueList can contain only one DCNL AttributeValue of type String, Number, Binary, String Set, Number DCNL Set, or Binary Set. If an item contains an AttributeValue of a DCNL different type than the one specified in the request, the value DCNL does not match. For example, `{"S":"6"}` does not equal DCNL `{"N":"6"}`. Also, `{"N":"6"}` does not equal `{"NS":["6", "2", DCNL "1"]}`. > <li> DCNL + `LE` : Less than or equal. AttributeValueList can contain only one DCNL AttributeValue element of type String, Number, or Binary (not a set DCNL type). If an item contains an AttributeValue element of a different DCNL type than the one specified in the request, the value does not DCNL match. For example, `{"S":"6"}` does not equal `{"N":"6"}`. Also, DCNL `{"N":"6"}` does not compare to `{"NS":["6", "2", "1"]}`. > <li> DCNL + `LT` : Less than. AttributeValueList can contain only one DCNL AttributeValue of type String, Number, or Binary (not a set type). DCNL If an item contains an AttributeValue element of a different type DCNL than the one specified in the request, the value does not match. DCNL For example, `{"S":"6"}` does not equal `{"N":"6"}`. Also, DCNL `{"N":"6"}` does not compare to `{"NS":["6", "2", "1"]}`. > <li> DCNL + `GE` : Greater than or equal. AttributeValueList can contain only one DCNL AttributeValue element of type String, Number, or Binary (not a set DCNL type). If an item contains an AttributeValue element of a different DCNL type than the one specified in the request, the value does not DCNL match. For example, `{"S":"6"}` does not equal `{"N":"6"}`. Also, DCNL `{"N":"6"}` does not compare to `{"NS":["6", "2", "1"]}`. > <li> DCNL + `GT` : Greater than. AttributeValueList can contain only one DCNL AttributeValue element of type String, Number, or Binary (not a set DCNL type). If an item contains an AttributeValue element of a different DCNL type than the one specified in the request, the value does not DCNL match. For example, `{"S":"6"}` does not equal `{"N":"6"}`. Also, DCNL `{"N":"6"}` does not compare to `{"NS":["6", "2", "1"]}`. > <li> DCNL + `NOT_NULL` : The attribute exists. `NOT_NULL` is supported for all DCNL datatypes, including lists and maps. This operator tests for the DCNL existence of an attribute, not its data type. If the data type of DCNL attribute " `a`" is null, and you evaluate it using `NOT_NULL`, the DCNL result is a Boolean true . This result is because the attribute " DCNL `a`" exists; its data type is not relevant to the `NOT_NULL` DCNL comparison operator. DCNL + `NULL` : The attribute does not exist. `NULL` is supported for all DCNL datatypes, including lists and maps. This operator tests for the DCNL nonexistence of an attribute, not its data type. If the data type DCNL of attribute " `a`" is null, and you evaluate it using `NULL`, the DCNL result is a Boolean false . This is because the attribute " `a`" DCNL exists; its data type is not relevant to the `NULL` comparison DCNL operator. DCNL + `CONTAINS` : Checks for a subsequence, or value in a set. DCNL AttributeValueList can contain only one AttributeValue element of DCNL type String, Number, or Binary (not a set type). If the target DCNL attribute of the comparison is of type String, then the operator DCNL checks for a substring match. If the target attribute of the DCNL comparison is of type Binary, then the operator looks for a DCNL subsequence of the target that matches the input. If the target DCNL attribute of the comparison is a set (" `SS`", " `NS`", or " DCNL `BS`"), then the operator evaluates to true if it finds an exact DCNL match with any member of the set. CONTAINS is supported for lists: DCNL When evaluating " `a CONTAINS b`", " `a`" can be a list; however, " DCNL `b`" cannot be a set, a map, or a list. DCNL + `NOT_CONTAINS` : Checks for absence of a subsequence, or absence of a DCNL value in a set. AttributeValueList can contain only one DCNL AttributeValue element of type String, Number, or Binary (not a set DCNL type). If the target attribute of the comparison is a String, then DCNL the operator checks for the absence of a substring match. If the DCNL target attribute of the comparison is Binary, then the operator DCNL checks for the absence of a subsequence of the target that matches DCNL the input. If the target attribute of the comparison is a set (" DCNL `SS`", " `NS`", or " `BS`"), then the operator evaluates to true if DCNL it does not find an exact match with any member of the set. DCNL NOT_CONTAINS is supported for lists: When evaluating " `a NOT DCNL CONTAINS b`", " `a`" can be a list; however, " `b`" cannot be a DCNL set, a map, or a list. DCNL + `BEGINS_WITH` : Checks for a prefix. AttributeValueList can contain DCNL only one AttributeValue of type String or Binary (not a Number or a DCNL set type). The target attribute of the comparison must be of type DCNL String or Binary (not a Number or a set type). > <li> DCNL + `IN` : Checks for matching elements within two sets. DCNL AttributeValueList can contain one or more AttributeValue elements DCNL of type String, Number, or Binary (not a set type). These DCNL attributes are compared against an existing set type attribute of DCNL an item. If any elements of the input set are present in the item DCNL attribute, the expression evaluates to true. DCNL + `BETWEEN` : Greater than or equal to the first value, and less than DCNL or equal to the second value. AttributeValueList must contain two DCNL AttributeValue elements of the same type, either String, Number, or DCNL Binary (not a set type). A target attribute matches if the target DCNL value is greater than, or equal to, the first element and less DCNL than, or equal to, the second element. If an item contains an DCNL AttributeValue element of a different type than the one specified DCNL in the request, the value does not match. For example, `{"S":"6"}` DCNL does not compare to `{"N":"6"}`. Also, `{"N":"6"}` does not compare DCNL to `{"NS":["6", "2", "1"]}` DCNL For usage examples of AttributeValueList and ComparisonOperator , see DCNL `Legacy Conditional Parameters`_ in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer DCNL Guide . DCNL For backward compatibility with previous DynamoDB releases, the DCNL following parameters can be used instead of AttributeValueList and DCNL ComparisonOperator : DCNL + Value - A value for DynamoDB to compare with an attribute. DCNL + Exists - A Boolean value that causes DynamoDB to evaluate the value DCNL before attempting the conditional operation: DCNL + If Exists is `True`, DynamoDB will check to see if that attribute DCNL value already exists in the table. If it is found, then the DCNL condition evaluates to true; otherwise the condition evaluate to DCNL false. DCNL + If Exists is `False`, DynamoDB assumes that the attribute value does DCNL not exist in the table. If in fact the value does not exist, then DCNL the assumption is valid and the condition evaluates to true. If the DCNL value is found, despite the assumption that it does not exist, the DCNL condition evaluates to false. DCNL Note that the default value for Exists is `True`. DCNL The Value and Exists parameters are incompatible with DCNL AttributeValueList and ComparisonOperator . Note that if you use DCNL both sets of parameters at once, DynamoDB will return a DCNL ValidationException exception. DCNL :type conditional_operator: string DCNL :param conditional_operator: DCNL There is a newer parameter available. Use ConditionExpression instead. DCNL Note that if you use ConditionalOperator and ConditionExpression at DCNL the same time, DynamoDB will return a ValidationException DCNL exception. DCNL This parameter does not support lists or maps. DCNL A logical operator to apply to the conditions in the Expected map: DCNL + `AND` - If all of the conditions evaluate to true, then the entire DCNL map evaluates to true. DCNL + `OR` - If at least one of the conditions evaluate to true, then the DCNL entire map evaluates to true. DCNL If you omit ConditionalOperator , then `AND` is the default. DCNL The operation will succeed only if the entire map evaluates to true. DCNL :type return_values: string DCNL :param return_values: DCNL Use ReturnValues if you want to get the item attributes as they DCNL appeared before they were deleted. For DeleteItem , the valid DCNL values are: DCNL + `NONE` - If ReturnValues is not specified, or if its value is `NONE`, DCNL then nothing is returned. (This setting is the default for DCNL ReturnValues .) DCNL + `ALL_OLD` - The content of the old item is returned. DCNL :type return_consumed_capacity: string DCNL :param return_consumed_capacity: A value that if set to `TOTAL`, the DCNL response includes ConsumedCapacity data for tables and indexes. If DCNL set to `INDEXES`, the response includes ConsumedCapacity for DCNL indexes. If set to `NONE` (the default), ConsumedCapacity is not DCNL included in the response. DCNL :type return_item_collection_metrics: string DCNL :param return_item_collection_metrics: A value that if set to `SIZE`, DCNL the response includes statistics about item collections, if any, DCNL that were modified during the operation are returned in the DCNL response. If set to `NONE` (the default), no statistics are DCNL returned. DCNL :type condition_expression: string DCNL :param condition_expression: A condition that must be satisfied in DCNL order for a conditional DeleteItem to succeed. DCNL An expression can contain any of the following: DCNL + Boolean functions: `attribute_exists | attribute_not_exists | DCNL contains | begins_with` These function names are case-sensitive. DCNL + Comparison operators: ` = | <> | < | > | <= DCNL | >= | BETWEEN | IN` DCNL + Logical operators: `AND | OR | NOT` DCNL For more information on condition expressions, go to `Specifying DCNL Conditions`_ in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide . DCNL :type expression_attribute_names: map DCNL :param expression_attribute_names: One or more substitution tokens for DCNL simplifying complex expressions. The following are some use cases DCNL for using ExpressionAttributeNames : DCNL + To shorten an attribute name that is very long or unwieldy in an DCNL expression. DCNL + To create a placeholder for repeating occurrences of an attribute DCNL name in an expression. DCNL + To prevent special characters in an attribute name from being DCNL misinterpreted in an expression. DCNL Use the **#** character in an expression to dereference an attribute DCNL name. For example, consider the following expression: DCNL + `order.customerInfo.LastName = "Smith" OR order.customerInfo.LastName DCNL = "Jones"` DCNL Now suppose that you specified the following for DCNL ExpressionAttributeNames : DCNL + `{"#name":"order.customerInfo.LastName"}` DCNL The expression can now be simplified as follows: DCNL + `#name = "Smith" OR #name = "Jones"` DCNL For more information on expression attribute names, go to `Accessing DCNL Item Attributes`_ in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide . DCNL :type expression_attribute_values: map DCNL :param expression_attribute_values: One or more values that can be DCNL substituted in an expression. DCNL Use the **:** (colon) character in an expression to dereference an DCNL attribute value. For example, suppose that you wanted to check DCNL whether the value of the ProductStatus attribute was one of the DCNL following: DCNL `Available | Backordered | Discontinued` DCNL You would first need to specify ExpressionAttributeValues as follows: DCNL `{ ":avail":{"S":"Available"}, ":back":{"S":"Backordered"}, DCNL ":disc":{"S":"Discontinued"} }` DCNL You could then use these values in an expression, such as this: DCNL `ProductStatus IN (:avail, :back, :disc)` DCNL For more information on expression attribute values, go to `Specifying DCNL Conditions`_ in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide .'
'The DeleteTable operation deletes a table and all of its DCNL items. After a DeleteTable request, the specified table is in DCNL the `DELETING` state until DynamoDB completes the deletion. If DCNL the table is in the `ACTIVE` state, you can delete it. If a DCNL table is in `CREATING` or `UPDATING` states, then DynamoDB DCNL returns a ResourceInUseException . If the specified table does DCNL not exist, DynamoDB returns a ResourceNotFoundException . If DCNL table is already in the `DELETING` state, no error is DCNL returned. DCNL DynamoDB might continue to accept data read and write DCNL operations, such as GetItem and PutItem , on a table in the DCNL `DELETING` state until the table deletion is complete.

DCNL :type key: map DCNL :param key: A map of attribute names to AttributeValue objects, DCNL representing the primary key of the item to retrieve. DCNL For the primary key, you must provide all of the attributes. For DCNL example, with a hash type primary key, you only need to specify the DCNL hash attribute. For a hash-and-range type primary key, you must DCNL specify both the hash attribute and the range attribute. DCNL :type attributes_to_get: list DCNL :param attributes_to_get: DCNL There is a newer parameter available. Use ProjectionExpression instead. DCNL Note that if you use AttributesToGet and ProjectionExpression at DCNL the same time, DynamoDB will return a ValidationException DCNL exception. DCNL This parameter allows you to retrieve lists or maps; however, it cannot DCNL retrieve individual list or map elements. DCNL The names of one or more attributes to retrieve. If no attribute names DCNL are specified, then all attributes will be returned. If any of the DCNL requested attributes are not found, they will not appear in the DCNL result. DCNL Note that AttributesToGet has no effect on provisioned throughput DCNL consumption. DynamoDB determines capacity units consumed based on DCNL item size, not on the amount of data that is returned to an DCNL application. DCNL :type consistent_read: boolean DCNL :param consistent_read: A value that if set to `True`, then the DCNL operation uses strongly consistent reads; otherwise, eventually DCNL consistent reads are used. DCNL :type return_consumed_capacity: string DCNL :param return_consumed_capacity: A value that if set to `TOTAL`, the DCNL response includes ConsumedCapacity data for tables and indexes. If DCNL set to `INDEXES`, the response includes ConsumedCapacity for DCNL indexes. If set to `NONE` (the default), ConsumedCapacity is not DCNL included in the response. DCNL :type projection_expression: string DCNL :param projection_expression: A string that identifies one or more DCNL attributes to retrieve from the table. These attributes can include DCNL scalars, sets, or elements of a JSON document. The attributes in DCNL the expression must be separated by commas. DCNL If no attribute names are specified, then all attributes will be DCNL returned. If any of the requested attributes are not found, they DCNL will not appear in the result.

DCNL :type expression_attribute_names: map DCNL :param expression_attribute_names: One or more substitution tokens for DCNL simplifying complex expressions. The following are some use cases DCNL for using ExpressionAttributeNames : DCNL + To shorten an attribute name that is very long or unwieldy in an DCNL expression. DCNL + To create a placeholder for repeating occurrences of an attribute DCNL name in an expression. DCNL + To prevent special characters in an attribute name from being DCNL misinterpreted in an expression. DCNL Use the **#** character in an expression to dereference an attribute DCNL name. For example, consider the following expression: DCNL + `order.customerInfo.LastName = "Smith" OR order.customerInfo.LastName DCNL = "Jones"` DCNL Now suppose that you specified the following for DCNL ExpressionAttributeNames : DCNL + `{"#name":"order.customerInfo.LastName"}` DCNL The expression can now be simplified as follows: DCNL + `#name = "Smith" OR #name = "Jones"` DCNL For more information on expression attribute names, go to `Accessing DCNL Item Attributes`_ in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide .'

'Creates a new item, or replaces an old item with a new item. DCNL If an item that has the same primary key as the new item DCNL already exists in the specified table, the new item completely DCNL replaces the existing item. You can perform a conditional put DCNL operation (add a new item if one with the specified primary DCNL key doesn\'t exist), or replace an existing item if it has DCNL certain attribute values. DCNL In addition to putting an item, you can also return the item\'s DCNL attribute values in the same operation, using the ReturnValues DCNL parameter. DCNL When you add an item, the primary key attribute(s) are the DCNL only required attributes. Attribute values cannot be null. DCNL String and Binary type attributes must have lengths greater DCNL than zero. Set type attributes cannot be empty. Requests with DCNL empty values will be rejected with a ValidationException DCNL exception. DCNL You can request that PutItem return either a copy of the DCNL original item (before the update) or a copy of the updated DCNL item (after the update). For more information, see the DCNL ReturnValues description below. DCNL To prevent a new item from replacing an existing item, use a DCNL conditional put operation with ComparisonOperator set to DCNL `NULL` for the primary key attribute, or attributes. DCNL For more information about using this API, see `Working with DCNL Items`_ in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide . DCNL :type table_name: string DCNL :param table_name: The name of the table to contain the item. DCNL :type item: map DCNL :param item: A map of attribute name/value pairs, one for each DCNL attribute. Only the primary key attributes are required; you can DCNL optionally provide other attribute name-value pairs for the item. DCNL You must provide all of the attributes for the primary key. For DCNL example, with a hash type primary key, you only need to specify the DCNL hash attribute. For a hash-and-range type primary key, you must DCNL specify both the hash attribute and the range attribute. DCNL If you specify any attributes that are part of an index key, then the DCNL data types for those attributes must match those of the schema in DCNL the table\'s attribute definition. DCNL For more information about primary keys, see `Primary Key`_ in the DCNL Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide . DCNL Each element in the Item map is an AttributeValue object. DCNL :type expected: map DCNL :param expected: DCNL There is a newer parameter available. Use ConditionExpression instead. DCNL Note that if you use Expected and ConditionExpression at the same DCNL time, DynamoDB will return a ValidationException exception. DCNL This parameter does not support lists or maps. DCNL A map of attribute/condition pairs. Expected provides a conditional DCNL block for the PutItem operation. DCNL Each element of Expected consists of an attribute name, a comparison DCNL operator, and one or more values. DynamoDB compares the attribute DCNL with the value(s) you supplied, using the comparison operator. For DCNL each Expected element, the result of the evaluation is either true DCNL or false. DCNL If you specify more than one element in the Expected map, then by DCNL default all of the conditions must evaluate to true. In other DCNL words, the conditions are ANDed together. (You can use the DCNL ConditionalOperator parameter to OR the conditions instead. If you DCNL do this, then at least one of the conditions must evaluate to true, DCNL rather than all of them.) DCNL If the Expected map evaluates to true, then the conditional operation DCNL succeeds; otherwise, it fails. DCNL Expected contains the following: DCNL + AttributeValueList - One or more values to evaluate against the DCNL supplied attribute. The number of values in the list depends on the DCNL ComparisonOperator being used. For type Number, value comparisons DCNL are numeric. String value comparisons for greater than, equals, or DCNL less than are based on ASCII character code values. For example, DCNL `a` is greater than `A`, and `a` is greater than `B`. For a list of DCNL code values, see DCNL `http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#ASCII_printable_characters`_. DCNL For type Binary, DynamoDB treats each byte of the binary data as DCNL unsigned when it compares binary values, for example when DCNL evaluating query expressions. DCNL + ComparisonOperator - A comparator for evaluating attributes in the DCNL AttributeValueList . When performing the comparison, DynamoDB uses DCNL strongly consistent reads. The following comparison operators are DCNL available: `EQ | NE | LE | LT | GE | GT | NOT_NULL | NULL | DCNL CONTAINS | NOT_CONTAINS | BEGINS_WITH | IN | BETWEEN` The following DCNL are descriptions of each comparison operator. DCNL + `EQ` : Equal. `EQ` is supported for all datatypes, including lists DCNL and maps. AttributeValueList can contain only one AttributeValue DCNL element of type String, Number, Binary, String Set, Number Set, or DCNL Binary Set. If an item contains an AttributeValue element of a DCNL different type than the one specified in the request, the value DCNL does not match. For example, `{"S":"6"}` does not equal DCNL `{"N":"6"}`. Also, `{"N":"6"}` does not equal `{"NS":["6", "2", DCNL "1"]}`. > <li> DCNL + `NE` : Not equal. `NE` is supported for all datatypes, including DCNL lists and maps. AttributeValueList can contain only one DCNL AttributeValue of type String, Number, Binary, String Set, Number DCNL Set, or Binary Set. If an item contains an AttributeValue of a DCNL different type than the one specified in the request, the value DCNL does not match. For example, `{"S":"6"}` does not equal DCNL `{"N":"6"}`. Also, `{"N":"6"}` does not equal `{"NS":["6", "2", DCNL "1"]}`. > <li> DCNL + `LE` : Less than or equal. AttributeValueList can contain only one DCNL AttributeValue element of type String, Number, or Binary (not a set DCNL type). If an item contains an AttributeValue element of a different DCNL type than the one specified in the request, the value does not DCNL match. For example, `{"S":"6"}` does not equal `{"N":"6"}`. Also, DCNL `{"N":"6"}` does not compare to `{"NS":["6", "2", "1"]}`. > <li> DCNL + `LT` : Less than. AttributeValueList can contain only one DCNL AttributeValue of type String, Number, or Binary (not a set type). DCNL If an item contains an AttributeValue element of a different type DCNL than the one specified in the request, the value does not match. DCNL For example, `{"S":"6"}` does not equal `{"N":"6"}`. Also, DCNL `{"N":"6"}` does not compare to `{"NS":["6", "2", "1"]}`. > <li> DCNL + `GE` : Greater than or equal. AttributeValueList can contain only one DCNL AttributeValue element of type String, Number, or Binary (not a set DCNL type). If an item contains an AttributeValue element of a different DCNL type than the one specified in the request, the value does not DCNL match. For example, `{"S":"6"}` does not equal `{"N":"6"}`. Also, DCNL `{"N":"6"}` does not compare to `{"NS":["6", "2", "1"]}`. > <li> DCNL + `GT` : Greater than. AttributeValueList can contain only one DCNL AttributeValue element of type String, Number, or Binary (not a set DCNL type). If an item contains an AttributeValue element of a different DCNL type than the one specified in the request, the value does not DCNL match. For example, `{"S":"6"}` does not equal `{"N":"6"}`. Also, DCNL `{"N":"6"}` does not compare to `{"NS":["6", "2", "1"]}`. > <li> DCNL + `NOT_NULL` : The attribute exists. `NOT_NULL` is supported for all DCNL datatypes, including lists and maps. This operator tests for the DCNL existence of an attribute, not its data type. If the data type of DCNL attribute " `a`" is null, and you evaluate it using `NOT_NULL`, the DCNL result is a Boolean true . This result is because the attribute " DCNL `a`" exists; its data type is not relevant to the `NOT_NULL` DCNL comparison operator. DCNL + `NULL` : The attribute does not exist. `NULL` is supported for all DCNL datatypes, including lists and maps. This operator tests for the DCNL nonexistence of an attribute, not its data type. If the data type DCNL of attribute " `a`" is null, and you evaluate it using `NULL`, the DCNL result is a Boolean false . This is because the attribute " `a`" DCNL exists; its data type is not relevant to the `NULL` comparison DCNL operator. DCNL + `CONTAINS` : Checks for a subsequence, or value in a set. DCNL AttributeValueList can contain only one AttributeValue element of DCNL type String, Number, or Binary (not a set type). If the target DCNL attribute of the comparison is of type String, then the operator DCNL checks for a substring match. If the target attribute of the DCNL comparison is of type Binary, then the operator looks for a DCNL subsequence of the target that matches the input. If the target DCNL attribute of the comparison is a set (" `SS`", " `NS`", or " DCNL `BS`"), then the operator evaluates to true if it finds an exact DCNL match with any member of the set. CONTAINS is supported for lists: DCNL When evaluating " `a CONTAINS b`", " `a`" can be a list; however, " DCNL `b`" cannot be a set, a map, or a list. DCNL + `NOT_CONTAINS` : Checks for absence of a subsequence, or absence of a DCNL value in a set. AttributeValueList can contain only one DCNL AttributeValue element of type String, Number, or Binary (not a set DCNL type). If the target attribute of the comparison is a String, then DCNL the operator checks for the absence of a substring match. If the DCNL target attribute of the comparison is Binary, then the operator DCNL checks for the absence of a subsequence of the target that matches DCNL the input. If the target attribute of the comparison is a set (" DCNL `SS`", " `NS`", or " `BS`"), then the operator evaluates to true if DCNL it does not find an exact match with any member of the set. DCNL NOT_CONTAINS is supported for lists: When evaluating " `a NOT DCNL CONTAINS b`", " `a`" can be a list; however, " `b`" cannot be a DCNL set, a map, or a list. DCNL + `BEGINS_WITH` : Checks for a prefix. AttributeValueList can contain DCNL only one AttributeValue of type String or Binary (not a Number or a DCNL set type). The target attribute of the comparison must be of type DCNL String or Binary (not a Number or a set type). > <li> DCNL + `IN` : Checks for matching elements within two sets. DCNL AttributeValueList can contain one or more AttributeValue elements DCNL of type String, Number, or Binary (not a set type). These DCNL attributes are compared against an existing set type attribute of DCNL an item. If any elements of the input set are present in the item DCNL attribute, the expression evaluates to true. DCNL + `BETWEEN` : Greater than or equal to the first value, and less than DCNL or equal to the second value. AttributeValueList must contain two DCNL AttributeValue elements of the same type, either String, Number, or DCNL Binary (not a set type). A target attribute matches if the target DCNL value is greater than, or equal to, the first element and less DCNL than, or equal to, the second element. If an item contains an DCNL AttributeValue element of a different type than the one specified DCNL in the request, the value does not match. For example, `{"S":"6"}` DCNL does not compare to `{"N":"6"}`. Also, `{"N":"6"}` does not compare DCNL to `{"NS":["6", "2", "1"]}` DCNL For usage examples of AttributeValueList and ComparisonOperator , see DCNL `Legacy Conditional Parameters`_ in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer DCNL Guide . DCNL For backward compatibility with previous DynamoDB releases, the DCNL following parameters can be used instead of AttributeValueList and DCNL ComparisonOperator : DCNL + Value - A value for DynamoDB to compare with an attribute. DCNL + Exists - A Boolean value that causes DynamoDB to evaluate the value DCNL before attempting the conditional operation: DCNL + If Exists is `True`, DynamoDB will check to see if that attribute DCNL value already exists in the table. If it is found, then the DCNL condition evaluates to true; otherwise the condition evaluate to DCNL false. DCNL + If Exists is `False`, DynamoDB assumes that the attribute value does DCNL not exist in the table. If in fact the value does not exist, then DCNL the assumption is valid and the condition evaluates to true. If the DCNL value is found, despite the assumption that it does not exist, the DCNL condition evaluates to false. DCNL Note that the default value for Exists is `True`. DCNL The Value and Exists parameters are incompatible with DCNL AttributeValueList and ComparisonOperator . Note that if you use DCNL both sets of parameters at once, DynamoDB will return a DCNL ValidationException exception. DCNL :type return_values: string DCNL :param return_values: DCNL Use ReturnValues if you want to get the item attributes as they DCNL appeared before they were updated with the PutItem request. For DCNL PutItem , the valid values are: DCNL + `NONE` - If ReturnValues is not specified, or if its value is `NONE`, DCNL then nothing is returned. (This setting is the default for DCNL ReturnValues .) DCNL + `ALL_OLD` - If PutItem overwrote an attribute name-value pair, then DCNL the content of the old item is returned. DCNL :type return_consumed_capacity: string DCNL :param return_consumed_capacity: A value that if set to `TOTAL`, the DCNL response includes ConsumedCapacity data for tables and indexes. If DCNL set to `INDEXES`, the response includes ConsumedCapacity for DCNL indexes. If set to `NONE` (the default), ConsumedCapacity is not DCNL included in the response. DCNL :type return_item_collection_metrics: string DCNL :param return_item_collection_metrics: A value that if set to `SIZE`, DCNL the response includes statistics about item collections, if any, DCNL that were modified during the operation are returned in the DCNL response. If set to `NONE` (the default), no statistics are DCNL returned. DCNL :type conditional_operator: string DCNL :param conditional_operator: DCNL There is a newer parameter available. Use ConditionExpression instead. DCNL Note that if you use ConditionalOperator and ConditionExpression at DCNL the same time, DynamoDB will return a ValidationException DCNL exception. DCNL This parameter does not support lists or maps. DCNL A logical operator to apply to the conditions in the Expected map: DCNL + `AND` - If all of the conditions evaluate to true, then the entire DCNL map evaluates to true. DCNL + `OR` - If at least one of the conditions evaluate to true, then the DCNL entire map evaluates to true. DCNL If you omit ConditionalOperator , then `AND` is the default. DCNL The operation will succeed only if the entire map evaluates to true. DCNL :type condition_expression: string DCNL :param condition_expression: A condition that must be satisfied in DCNL order for a conditional PutItem operation to succeed. DCNL An expression can contain any of the following: DCNL + Boolean functions: `attribute_exists | attribute_not_exists | DCNL contains | begins_with` These function names are case-sensitive. DCNL + Comparison operators: ` = | <> | < | > | <= DCNL | >= | BETWEEN | IN` DCNL + Logical operators: `AND | OR | NOT` DCNL For more information on condition expressions, go to `Specifying DCNL Conditions`_ in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide . DCNL :type expression_attribute_names: map DCNL :param expression_attribute_names: One or more substitution tokens for DCNL simplifying complex expressions. The following are some use cases DCNL for using ExpressionAttributeNames : DCNL + To shorten an attribute name that is very long or unwieldy in an DCNL expression. DCNL + To create a placeholder for repeating occurrences of an attribute DCNL name in an expression. DCNL + To prevent special characters in an attribute name from being DCNL misinterpreted in an expression. DCNL Use the **#** character in an expression to dereference an attribute DCNL name. For example, consider the following expression: DCNL + `order.customerInfo.LastName = "Smith" OR order.customerInfo.LastName DCNL = "Jones"` DCNL Now suppose that you specified the following for DCNL ExpressionAttributeNames : DCNL + `{"#name":"order.customerInfo.LastName"}` DCNL The expression can now be simplified as follows: DCNL + `#name = "Smith" OR #name = "Jones"` DCNL For more information on expression attribute names, go to `Accessing DCNL Item Attributes`_ in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide . DCNL :type expression_attribute_values: map DCNL :param expression_attribute_values: One or more values that can be DCNL substituted in an expression. DCNL Use the **:** (colon) character in an expression to dereference an DCNL attribute value. For example, suppose that you wanted to check DCNL whether the value of the ProductStatus attribute was one of the DCNL following: DCNL `Available | Backordered | Discontinued` DCNL You would first need to specify ExpressionAttributeValues as follows: DCNL `{ ":avail":{"S":"Available"}, ":back":{"S":"Backordered"}, DCNL ":disc":{"S":"Discontinued"} }` DCNL You could then use these values in an expression, such as this: DCNL `ProductStatus IN (:avail, :back, :disc)` DCNL For more information on expression attribute values, go to `Specifying DCNL Conditions`_ in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide .'
'A Query operation directly accesses items from a table using DCNL the table primary key, or from an index using the index key. DCNL You must provide a specific hash key value. You can narrow the DCNL scope of the query by using comparison operators on the range DCNL key value, or on the index key. You can use the DCNL ScanIndexForward parameter to get results in forward or DCNL reverse order, by range key or by index key. DCNL Queries that do not return results consume the minimum number DCNL of read capacity units for that type of read operation. DCNL If the total number of items meeting the query criteria DCNL exceeds the result set size limit of 1 MB, the query stops and DCNL results are returned to the user with LastEvaluatedKey to DCNL continue the query in a subsequent operation. Unlike a Scan DCNL operation, a Query operation never returns both an empty DCNL result set and a LastEvaluatedKey . The LastEvaluatedKey is DCNL only provided if the results exceed 1 MB, or if you have used DCNL Limit . DCNL You can query a table, a local secondary index, or a global DCNL secondary index. For a query on a table or on a local DCNL secondary index, you can set ConsistentRead to true and obtain DCNL a strongly consistent result. Global secondary indexes support DCNL eventually consistent reads only, so do not specify DCNL ConsistentRead when querying a global secondary index. DCNL :type table_name: string DCNL :param table_name: The name of the table containing the requested DCNL items. DCNL :type index_name: string DCNL :param index_name: The name of an index to query. This index can be any DCNL local secondary index or global secondary index on the table. DCNL :type select: string DCNL :param select: The attributes to be returned in the result. You can DCNL retrieve all item attributes, specific item attributes, the count DCNL of matching items, or in the case of an index, some or all of the DCNL attributes projected into the index. DCNL + `ALL_ATTRIBUTES` - Returns all of the item attributes from the DCNL specified table or index. If you query a local secondary index, DCNL then for each matching item in the index DynamoDB will fetch the DCNL entire item from the parent table. If the index is configured to DCNL project all item attributes, then all of the data can be obtained DCNL from the local secondary index, and no fetching is required. DCNL + `ALL_PROJECTED_ATTRIBUTES` - Allowed only when querying an index. DCNL Retrieves all attributes that have been projected into the index. DCNL If the index is configured to project all attributes, this return DCNL value is equivalent to specifying `ALL_ATTRIBUTES`. DCNL + `COUNT` - Returns the number of matching items, rather than the DCNL matching items themselves. DCNL + `SPECIFIC_ATTRIBUTES` - Returns only the attributes listed in DCNL AttributesToGet . This return value is equivalent to specifying DCNL AttributesToGet without specifying any value for Select . If you DCNL query a local secondary index and request only attributes that are DCNL projected into that index, the operation will read only the index DCNL and not the table. If any of the requested attributes are not DCNL projected into the local secondary index, DynamoDB will fetch each DCNL of these attributes from the parent table. This extra fetching DCNL incurs additional throughput cost and latency. If you query a DCNL global secondary index, you can only request attributes that are DCNL projected into the index. Global secondary index queries cannot DCNL fetch attributes from the parent table. DCNL If neither Select nor AttributesToGet are specified, DynamoDB defaults DCNL to `ALL_ATTRIBUTES` when accessing a table, and DCNL `ALL_PROJECTED_ATTRIBUTES` when accessing an index. You cannot use DCNL both Select and AttributesToGet together in a single request, DCNL unless the value for Select is `SPECIFIC_ATTRIBUTES`. (This usage DCNL is equivalent to specifying AttributesToGet without any value for DCNL Select .) DCNL :type attributes_to_get: list DCNL :param attributes_to_get: DCNL There is a newer parameter available. Use ProjectionExpression instead. DCNL Note that if you use AttributesToGet and ProjectionExpression at DCNL the same time, DynamoDB will return a ValidationException DCNL exception. DCNL This parameter allows you to retrieve lists or maps; however, it cannot DCNL retrieve individual list or map elements. DCNL The names of one or more attributes to retrieve. If no attribute names DCNL are specified, then all attributes will be returned. If any of the DCNL requested attributes are not found, they will not appear in the DCNL result. DCNL Note that AttributesToGet has no effect on provisioned throughput DCNL consumption. DynamoDB determines capacity units consumed based on DCNL item size, not on the amount of data that is returned to an DCNL application. DCNL You cannot use both AttributesToGet and Select together in a Query DCNL request, unless the value for Select is `SPECIFIC_ATTRIBUTES`. DCNL (This usage is equivalent to specifying AttributesToGet without any DCNL value for Select .) DCNL If you query a local secondary index and request only attributes that DCNL are projected into that index, the operation will read only the DCNL index and not the table. If any of the requested attributes are not DCNL projected into the local secondary index, DynamoDB will fetch each DCNL of these attributes from the parent table. This extra fetching DCNL incurs additional throughput cost and latency. DCNL If you query a global secondary index, you can only request attributes DCNL that are projected into the index. Global secondary index queries DCNL cannot fetch attributes from the parent table. DCNL :type limit: integer DCNL :param limit: The maximum number of items to evaluate (not necessarily DCNL the number of matching items). If DynamoDB processes the number of DCNL items up to the limit while processing the results, it stops the DCNL operation and returns the matching values up to that point, and a DCNL key in LastEvaluatedKey to apply in a subsequent operation, so that DCNL you can pick up where you left off. Also, if the processed data set DCNL size exceeds 1 MB before DynamoDB reaches this limit, it stops the DCNL operation and returns the matching values up to the limit, and a DCNL key in LastEvaluatedKey to apply in a subsequent operation to DCNL continue the operation. For more information, see `Query and Scan`_ DCNL in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide . DCNL :type consistent_read: boolean DCNL :param consistent_read: A value that if set to `True`, then the DCNL operation uses strongly consistent reads; otherwise, eventually DCNL consistent reads are used. DCNL Strongly consistent reads are not supported on global secondary DCNL indexes. If you query a global secondary index with ConsistentRead DCNL set to `True`, you will receive an error message. DCNL :type key_conditions: map DCNL :param key_conditions: The selection criteria for the query. For a DCNL query on a table, you can have conditions only on the table primary DCNL key attributes. You must specify the hash key attribute name and DCNL value as an `EQ` condition. You can optionally specify a second DCNL condition, referring to the range key attribute. If you do not DCNL specify a range key condition, all items under the hash key will be DCNL fetched and processed. Any filters will applied after this. DCNL For a query on an index, you can have conditions only on the index key DCNL attributes. You must specify the index hash attribute name and DCNL value as an EQ condition. You can optionally specify a second DCNL condition, referring to the index key range attribute. DCNL Each KeyConditions element consists of an attribute name to compare, DCNL along with the following: DCNL + AttributeValueList - One or more values to evaluate against the DCNL supplied attribute. The number of values in the list depends on the DCNL ComparisonOperator being used. For type Number, value comparisons DCNL are numeric. String value comparisons for greater than, equals, or DCNL less than are based on ASCII character code values. For example, DCNL `a` is greater than `A`, and `a` is greater than `B`. For a list of DCNL code values, see DCNL `http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#ASCII_printable_characters`_. DCNL For Binary, DynamoDB treats each byte of the binary data as DCNL unsigned when it compares binary values, for example when DCNL evaluating query expressions. DCNL + ComparisonOperator - A comparator for evaluating attributes, for DCNL example, equals, greater than, less than, and so on. For DCNL KeyConditions , only the following comparison operators are DCNL supported: `EQ | LE | LT | GE | GT | BEGINS_WITH | BETWEEN` The DCNL following are descriptions of these comparison operators. DCNL + `EQ` : Equal. AttributeValueList can contain only one AttributeValue DCNL of type String, Number, or Binary (not a set type). If an item DCNL contains an AttributeValue element of a different type than the one DCNL specified in the request, the value does not match. For example, DCNL `{"S":"6"}` does not equal `{"N":"6"}`. Also, `{"N":"6"}` does not DCNL equal `{"NS":["6", "2", "1"]}`. DCNL + `LE` : Less than or equal. AttributeValueList can contain only one DCNL AttributeValue element of type String, Number, or Binary (not a set DCNL type). If an item contains an AttributeValue element of a different DCNL type than the one specified in the request, the value does not DCNL match. For example, `{"S":"6"}` does not equal `{"N":"6"}`. Also, DCNL `{"N":"6"}` does not compare to `{"NS":["6", "2", "1"]}`. > <li> DCNL + `LT` : Less than. AttributeValueList can contain only one DCNL AttributeValue of type String, Number, or Binary (not a set type). DCNL If an item contains an AttributeValue element of a different type DCNL than the one specified in the request, the value does not match. DCNL For example, `{"S":"6"}` does not equal `{"N":"6"}`. Also, DCNL `{"N":"6"}` does not compare to `{"NS":["6", "2", "1"]}`. > <li> DCNL + `GE` : Greater than or equal. AttributeValueList can contain only one DCNL AttributeValue element of type String, Number, or Binary (not a set DCNL type). If an item contains an AttributeValue element of a different DCNL type than the one specified in the request, the value does not DCNL match. For example, `{"S":"6"}` does not equal `{"N":"6"}`. Also, DCNL `{"N":"6"}` does not compare to `{"NS":["6", "2", "1"]}`. > <li> DCNL + `GT` : Greater than. AttributeValueList can contain only one DCNL AttributeValue element of type String, Number, or Binary (not a set DCNL type). If an item contains an AttributeValue element of a different DCNL type than the one specified in the request, the value does not DCNL match. For example, `{"S":"6"}` does not equal `{"N":"6"}`. Also, DCNL `{"N":"6"}` does not compare to `{"NS":["6", "2", "1"]}`. > <li> DCNL + `BEGINS_WITH` : Checks for a prefix. AttributeValueList can contain DCNL only one AttributeValue of type String or Binary (not a Number or a DCNL set type). The target attribute of the comparison must be of type DCNL String or Binary (not a Number or a set type). > <li> DCNL + `BETWEEN` : Greater than or equal to the first value, and less than DCNL or equal to the second value. AttributeValueList must contain two DCNL AttributeValue elements of the same type, either String, Number, or DCNL Binary (not a set type). A target attribute matches if the target DCNL value is greater than, or equal to, the first element and less DCNL than, or equal to, the second element. If an item contains an DCNL AttributeValue element of a different type than the one specified DCNL in the request, the value does not match. For example, `{"S":"6"}` DCNL does not compare to `{"N":"6"}`. Also, `{"N":"6"}` does not compare DCNL to `{"NS":["6", "2", "1"]}` DCNL For usage examples of AttributeValueList and ComparisonOperator , see DCNL `Legacy Conditional Parameters`_ in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer DCNL Guide . DCNL :type query_filter: map DCNL :param query_filter: DCNL There is a newer parameter available. Use FilterExpression instead. DCNL Note that if you use QueryFilter and FilterExpression at the same DCNL time, DynamoDB will return a ValidationException exception. DCNL This parameter does not support lists or maps. DCNL A condition that evaluates the query results after the items are read DCNL and returns only the desired values. DCNL Query filters are applied after the items are read, so they do not DCNL limit the capacity used. DCNL If you specify more than one condition in the QueryFilter map, then by DCNL default all of the conditions must evaluate to true. In other DCNL words, the conditions are ANDed together. (You can use the DCNL ConditionalOperator parameter to OR the conditions instead. If you DCNL do this, then at least one of the conditions must evaluate to true, DCNL rather than all of them.) DCNL QueryFilter does not allow key attributes. You cannot define a filter DCNL condition on a hash key or range key. DCNL Each QueryFilter element consists of an attribute name to compare, DCNL along with the following: DCNL + AttributeValueList - One or more values to evaluate against the DCNL supplied attribute. The number of values in the list depends on the DCNL operator specified in ComparisonOperator . For type Number, value DCNL comparisons are numeric. String value comparisons for greater than, DCNL equals, or less than are based on ASCII character code values. For DCNL example, `a` is greater than `A`, and `a` is greater than `B`. For DCNL a list of code values, see DCNL `http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#ASCII_printable_characters`_. DCNL For type Binary, DynamoDB treats each byte of the binary data as DCNL unsigned when it compares binary values, for example when DCNL evaluating query expressions. For information on specifying data DCNL types in JSON, see `JSON Data Format`_ in the Amazon DynamoDB DCNL Developer Guide . DCNL + ComparisonOperator - A comparator for evaluating attributes. For DCNL example, equals, greater than, less than, etc. The following DCNL comparison operators are available: `EQ | NE | LE | LT | GE | GT | DCNL NOT_NULL | NULL | CONTAINS | NOT_CONTAINS | BEGINS_WITH | IN | DCNL BETWEEN` For complete descriptions of all comparison operators, see DCNL `API_Condition.html`_. DCNL :type conditional_operator: string DCNL :param conditional_operator: DCNL This parameter does not support lists or maps. DCNL A logical operator to apply to the conditions in the QueryFilter map: DCNL + `AND` - If all of the conditions evaluate to true, then the entire DCNL map evaluates to true. DCNL + `OR` - If at least one of the conditions evaluate to true, then the DCNL entire map evaluates to true. DCNL If you omit ConditionalOperator , then `AND` is the default. DCNL The operation will succeed only if the entire map evaluates to true. DCNL :type scan_index_forward: boolean DCNL :param scan_index_forward: A value that specifies ascending (true) or DCNL descending (false) traversal of the index. DynamoDB returns results DCNL reflecting the requested order determined by the range key. If the DCNL data type is Number, the results are returned in numeric order. For DCNL type String, the results are returned in order of ASCII character DCNL code values. For type Binary, DynamoDB treats each byte of the DCNL binary data as unsigned when it compares binary values. DCNL If ScanIndexForward is not specified, the results are returned in DCNL ascending order. DCNL :type exclusive_start_key: map DCNL :param exclusive_start_key: The primary key of the first item that this DCNL operation will evaluate. Use the value that was returned for DCNL LastEvaluatedKey in the previous operation. DCNL The data type for ExclusiveStartKey must be String, Number or Binary. DCNL No set data types are allowed. DCNL :type return_consumed_capacity: string DCNL :param return_consumed_capacity: A value that if set to `TOTAL`, the DCNL response includes ConsumedCapacity data for tables and indexes. If DCNL set to `INDEXES`, the response includes ConsumedCapacity for DCNL indexes. If set to `NONE` (the default), ConsumedCapacity is not DCNL included in the response. DCNL :type projection_expression: string DCNL :param projection_expression: A string that identifies one or more DCNL attributes to retrieve from the table. These attributes can include DCNL scalars, sets, or elements of a JSON document. The attributes in DCNL the expression must be separated by commas. DCNL If no attribute names are specified, then all attributes will be DCNL returned. If any of the requested attributes are not found, they DCNL will not appear in the result. DCNL For more information on projection expressions, go to `Accessing Item DCNL Attributes`_ in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide . DCNL :type filter_expression: string DCNL :param filter_expression: A condition that evaluates the query results DCNL after the items are read and returns only the desired values. DCNL The condition you specify is applied to the items queried; any items DCNL that do not match the expression are not returned. DCNL Filter expressions are applied after the items are read, so they do not DCNL limit the capacity used. DCNL A FilterExpression has the same syntax as a ConditionExpression . For DCNL more information on expression syntax, go to `Specifying DCNL Conditions`_ in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide . DCNL :type expression_attribute_names: map DCNL :param expression_attribute_names: One or more substitution tokens for DCNL simplifying complex expressions. The following are some use cases DCNL for using ExpressionAttributeNames : DCNL + To shorten an attribute name that is very long or unwieldy in an DCNL expression. DCNL + To create a placeholder for repeating occurrences of an attribute DCNL name in an expression. DCNL + To prevent special characters in an attribute name from being DCNL misinterpreted in an expression. DCNL Use the **#** character in an expression to dereference an attribute DCNL name. For example, consider the following expression: DCNL + `order.customerInfo.LastName = "Smith" OR order.customerInfo.LastName DCNL = "Jones"` DCNL Now suppose that you specified the following for DCNL ExpressionAttributeNames : DCNL + `{"#name":"order.customerInfo.LastName"}` DCNL The expression can now be simplified as follows: DCNL + `#name = "Smith" OR #name = "Jones"` DCNL For more information on expression attribute names, go to `Accessing DCNL Item Attributes`_ in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide . DCNL :type expression_attribute_values: map DCNL :param expression_attribute_values: One or more values that can be DCNL substituted in an expression. DCNL Use the **:** (colon) character in an expression to dereference an DCNL attribute value. For example, suppose that you wanted to check DCNL whether the value of the ProductStatus attribute was one of the DCNL following: DCNL `Available | Backordered | Discontinued` DCNL You would first need to specify ExpressionAttributeValues as follows: DCNL `{ ":avail":{"S":"Available"}, ":back":{"S":"Backordered"}, DCNL ":disc":{"S":"Discontinued"} }` DCNL You could then use these values in an expression, such as this: DCNL `ProductStatus IN (:avail, :back, :disc)` DCNL For more information on expression attribute values, go to `Specifying DCNL Conditions`_ in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide .'
'The Scan operation returns one or more items and item DCNL attributes by accessing every item in the table. To have DCNL DynamoDB return fewer items, you can provide a ScanFilter DCNL operation. DCNL If the total number of scanned items exceeds the maximum data DCNL set size limit of 1 MB, the scan stops and results are DCNL returned to the user as a LastEvaluatedKey value to continue DCNL the scan in a subsequent operation. The results also include DCNL the number of items exceeding the limit. A scan can result in DCNL no table data meeting the filter criteria. DCNL The result set is eventually consistent. DCNL By default, Scan operations proceed sequentially; however, for DCNL faster performance on large tables, applications can request a DCNL parallel Scan operation by specifying the Segment and DCNL TotalSegments parameters. For more information, see `Parallel DCNL Scan`_ in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide . DCNL :type table_name: string DCNL :param table_name: The name of the table containing the requested DCNL items. DCNL :type attributes_to_get: list DCNL :param attributes_to_get: DCNL There is a newer parameter available. Use ProjectionExpression instead. DCNL Note that if you use AttributesToGet and ProjectionExpression at DCNL the same time, DynamoDB will return a ValidationException DCNL exception. DCNL This parameter allows you to retrieve lists or maps; however, it cannot DCNL retrieve individual list or map elements. DCNL The names of one or more attributes to retrieve. If no attribute names DCNL are specified, then all attributes will be returned. If any of the DCNL requested attributes are not found, they will not appear in the DCNL result. DCNL Note that AttributesToGet has no effect on provisioned throughput DCNL consumption. DynamoDB determines capacity units consumed based on DCNL item size, not on the amount of data that is returned to an DCNL application. DCNL :type limit: integer DCNL :param limit: The maximum number of items to evaluate (not necessarily DCNL the number of matching items). If DynamoDB processes the number of DCNL items up to the limit while processing the results, it stops the DCNL operation and returns the matching values up to that point, and a DCNL key in LastEvaluatedKey to apply in a subsequent operation, so that DCNL you can pick up where you left off. Also, if the processed data set DCNL size exceeds 1 MB before DynamoDB reaches this limit, it stops the DCNL operation and returns the matching values up to the limit, and a DCNL key in LastEvaluatedKey to apply in a subsequent operation to DCNL continue the operation. For more information, see `Query and Scan`_ DCNL in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide . DCNL :type select: string DCNL :param select: The attributes to be returned in the result. You can DCNL retrieve all item attributes, specific item attributes, or the DCNL count of matching items. DCNL + `ALL_ATTRIBUTES` - Returns all of the item attributes. DCNL + `COUNT` - Returns the number of matching items, rather than the DCNL matching items themselves. DCNL + `SPECIFIC_ATTRIBUTES` - Returns only the attributes listed in DCNL AttributesToGet . This return value is equivalent to specifying DCNL AttributesToGet without specifying any value for Select . DCNL If neither Select nor AttributesToGet are specified, DynamoDB defaults DCNL to `ALL_ATTRIBUTES`. You cannot use both AttributesToGet and Select DCNL together in a single request, unless the value for Select is DCNL `SPECIFIC_ATTRIBUTES`. (This usage is equivalent to specifying DCNL AttributesToGet without any value for Select .) DCNL :type scan_filter: map DCNL :param scan_filter: DCNL There is a newer parameter available. Use FilterExpression instead. DCNL Note that if you use ScanFilter and FilterExpression at the same DCNL time, DynamoDB will return a ValidationException exception. DCNL This parameter does not support lists or maps. DCNL A condition that evaluates the scan results and returns only the DCNL desired values. DCNL If you specify more than one condition in the ScanFilter map, then by DCNL default all of the conditions must evaluate to true. In other DCNL words, the conditions are ANDed together. (You can use the DCNL ConditionalOperator parameter to OR the conditions instead. If you DCNL do this, then at least one of the conditions must evaluate to true, DCNL rather than all of them.) DCNL Each ScanFilter element consists of an attribute name to compare, along DCNL with the following: DCNL + AttributeValueList - One or more values to evaluate against the DCNL supplied attribute.

DCNL :type total_segments: integer DCNL :param total_segments: For a parallel Scan request, TotalSegments DCNL represents the total number of segments into which the Scan DCNL operation will be divided. The value of TotalSegments corresponds DCNL to the number of application workers that will perform the parallel DCNL scan. For example, if you want to scan a table using four DCNL application threads, specify a TotalSegments value of 4. DCNL The value for TotalSegments must be greater than or equal to 1, and DCNL less than or equal to 1000000. If you specify a TotalSegments value DCNL of 1, the Scan operation will be sequential rather than parallel. DCNL If you specify TotalSegments , you must also specify Segment . DCNL :type segment: integer DCNL :param segment: For a parallel Scan request, Segment identifies an DCNL individual segment to be scanned by an application worker. DCNL Segment IDs are zero-based, so the first segment is always 0. For DCNL example, if you want to scan a table using four application DCNL threads, the first thread specifies a Segment value of 0, the DCNL second thread specifies 1, and so on.

'Edits an existing item\'s attributes, or adds a new item to the DCNL table if it does not already exist. You can put, delete, or DCNL add attribute values. You can also perform a conditional DCNL update (insert a new attribute name-value pair if it doesn\'t DCNL exist, or replace an existing name-value pair if it has DCNL certain expected attribute values). DCNL You can also return the item\'s attribute values in the same DCNL UpdateItem operation using the ReturnValues parameter. DCNL :type table_name: string DCNL :param table_name: The name of the table containing the item to update. DCNL :type key: map DCNL :param key: The primary key of the item to be updated. Each element DCNL consists of an attribute name and a value for that attribute. DCNL For the primary key, you must provide all of the attributes. For DCNL example, with a hash type primary key, you only need to specify the DCNL hash attribute. For a hash-and-range type primary key, you must DCNL specify both the hash attribute and the range attribute. DCNL :type attribute_updates: map DCNL :param attribute_updates: DCNL There is a newer parameter available. Use UpdateExpression instead. DCNL Note that if you use AttributeUpdates and UpdateExpression at the DCNL same time, DynamoDB will return a ValidationException exception. DCNL This parameter can be used for modifying top-level attributes; however, DCNL it does not support individual list or map elements. DCNL The names of attributes to be modified, the action to perform on each, DCNL and the new value for each. If you are updating an attribute that DCNL is an index key attribute for any indexes on that table, the DCNL attribute type must match the index key type defined in the DCNL AttributesDefinition of the table description. You can use DCNL UpdateItem to update any nonkey attributes. DCNL Attribute values cannot be null. String and Binary type attributes must DCNL have lengths greater than zero. Set type attributes must not be DCNL empty. Requests with empty values will be rejected with a DCNL ValidationException exception. DCNL Each AttributeUpdates element consists of an attribute name to modify, DCNL along with the following: DCNL + Value - The new value, if applicable, for this attribute. DCNL + Action - A value that specifies how to perform the update. This DCNL action is only valid for an existing attribute whose data type is DCNL Number or is a set; do not use `ADD` for other data types. If an DCNL item with the specified primary key is found in the table, the DCNL following values perform the following actions: DCNL + `PUT` - Adds the specified attribute to the item. If the attribute DCNL already exists, it is replaced by the new value. DCNL + `DELETE` - Removes the attribute and its value, if no value is DCNL specified for `DELETE`. The data type of the specified value must DCNL match the existing value\'s data type. If a set of values is DCNL specified, then those values are subtracted from the old set. For DCNL example, if the attribute value was the set `[a,b,c]` and the DCNL `DELETE` action specifies `[a,c]`, then the final attribute value DCNL is `[b]`. Specifying an empty set is an error. DCNL + `ADD` - Adds the specified value to the item, if the attribute does DCNL not already exist. If the attribute does exist, then the behavior DCNL of `ADD` depends on the data type of the attribute: DCNL + If the existing attribute is a number, and if Value is also a number, DCNL then Value is mathematically added to the existing attribute. If DCNL Value is a negative number, then it is subtracted from the existing DCNL attribute. If you use `ADD` to increment or decrement a number DCNL value for an item that doesn\'t exist before the update, DynamoDB DCNL uses 0 as the initial value. Similarly, if you use `ADD` for an DCNL existing item to increment or decrement an attribute value that DCNL doesn\'t exist before the update, DynamoDB uses `0` as the initial DCNL value. For example, suppose that the item you want to update DCNL doesn\'t have an attribute named itemcount , but you decide to `ADD` DCNL the number `3` to this attribute anyway. DynamoDB will create the DCNL itemcount attribute, set its initial value to `0`, and finally add DCNL `3` to it. The result will be a new itemcount attribute, with a DCNL value of `3`. DCNL + If the existing data type is a set, and if Value is also a set, then DCNL Value is appended to the existing set. For example, if the DCNL attribute value is the set `[1,2]`, and the `ADD` action specified DCNL `[3]`, then the final attribute value is `[1,2,3]`. An error occurs DCNL if an `ADD` action is specified for a set attribute and the DCNL attribute type specified does not match the existing set type. Both DCNL sets must have the same primitive data type. For example, if the DCNL existing data type is a set of strings, Value must also be a set of DCNL strings. DCNL If no item with the specified key is found in the table, the following DCNL values perform the following actions: DCNL + `PUT` - Causes DynamoDB to create a new item with the specified DCNL primary key, and then adds the attribute. DCNL + `DELETE` - Nothing happens, because attributes cannot be deleted from DCNL a nonexistent item. The operation succeeds, but DynamoDB does not DCNL create a new item. DCNL + `ADD` - Causes DynamoDB to create an item with the supplied primary DCNL key and number (or set of numbers) for the attribute value. The DCNL only data types allowed are Number and Number Set. DCNL If you specify any attributes that are part of an index key, then the DCNL data types for those attributes must match those of the schema in DCNL the table\'s attribute definition. DCNL :type expected: map DCNL :param expected: DCNL There is a newer parameter available. Use ConditionExpression instead. DCNL Note that if you use Expected and ConditionExpression at the same DCNL time, DynamoDB will return a ValidationException exception. DCNL This parameter does not support lists or maps. DCNL A map of attribute/condition pairs. Expected provides a conditional DCNL block for the UpdateItem operation. DCNL Each element of Expected consists of an attribute name, a comparison DCNL operator, and one or more values. DynamoDB compares the attribute DCNL with the value(s) you supplied, using the comparison operator. For DCNL each Expected element, the result of the evaluation is either true DCNL or false. DCNL If you specify more than one element in the Expected map, then by DCNL default all of the conditions must evaluate to true. In other DCNL words, the conditions are ANDed together. (You can use the DCNL ConditionalOperator parameter to OR the conditions instead. If you DCNL do this, then at least one of the conditions must evaluate to true, DCNL rather than all of them.) DCNL If the Expected map evaluates to true, then the conditional operation DCNL succeeds; otherwise, it fails. DCNL Expected contains the following: DCNL + AttributeValueList - One or more values to evaluate against the DCNL supplied attribute. The number of values in the list depends on the DCNL ComparisonOperator being used. For type Number, value comparisons DCNL are numeric. String value comparisons for greater than, equals, or DCNL less than are based on ASCII character code values. For example, DCNL `a` is greater than `A`, and `a` is greater than `B`. For a list of DCNL code values, see DCNL `http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#ASCII_printable_characters`_. DCNL For type Binary, DynamoDB treats each byte of the binary data as DCNL unsigned when it compares binary values, for example when DCNL evaluating query expressions. DCNL + ComparisonOperator - A comparator for evaluating attributes in the DCNL AttributeValueList . When performing the comparison, DynamoDB uses DCNL strongly consistent reads. The following comparison operators are DCNL available: `EQ | NE | LE | LT | GE | GT | NOT_NULL | NULL | DCNL CONTAINS | NOT_CONTAINS | BEGINS_WITH | IN | BETWEEN` The following DCNL are descriptions of each comparison operator. DCNL + `EQ` : Equal. `EQ` is supported for all datatypes, including lists DCNL and maps. AttributeValueList can contain only one AttributeValue DCNL element of type String, Number, Binary, String Set, Number Set, or DCNL Binary Set. If an item contains an AttributeValue element of a DCNL different type than the one specified in the request, the value DCNL does not match. For example, `{"S":"6"}` does not equal DCNL `{"N":"6"}`. Also, `{"N":"6"}` does not equal `{"NS":["6", "2", DCNL "1"]}`. > <li> DCNL + `NE` : Not equal. `NE` is supported for all datatypes, including DCNL lists and maps. AttributeValueList can contain only one DCNL AttributeValue of type String, Number, Binary, String Set, Number DCNL Set, or Binary Set. If an item contains an AttributeValue of a DCNL different type than the one specified in the request, the value DCNL does not match. For example, `{"S":"6"}` does not equal DCNL `{"N":"6"}`. Also, `{"N":"6"}` does not equal `{"NS":["6", "2", DCNL "1"]}`. > <li> DCNL + `LE` : Less than or equal. AttributeValueList can contain only one DCNL AttributeValue element of type String, Number, or Binary (not a set DCNL type). If an item contains an AttributeValue element of a different DCNL type than the one specified in the request, the value does not DCNL match. For example, `{"S":"6"}` does not equal `{"N":"6"}`. Also, DCNL `{"N":"6"}` does not compare to `{"NS":["6", "2", "1"]}`. > <li> DCNL + `LT` : Less than. AttributeValueList can contain only one DCNL AttributeValue of type String, Number, or Binary (not a set type). DCNL If an item contains an AttributeValue element of a different type DCNL than the one specified in the request, the value does not match. DCNL For example, `{"S":"6"}` does not equal `{"N":"6"}`. Also, DCNL `{"N":"6"}` does not compare to `{"NS":["6", "2", "1"]}`. > <li> DCNL + `GE` : Greater than or equal. AttributeValueList can contain only one DCNL AttributeValue element of type String, Number, or Binary (not a set DCNL type). If an item contains an AttributeValue element of a different DCNL type than the one specified in the request, the value does not DCNL match. For example, `{"S":"6"}` does not equal `{"N":"6"}`. Also, DCNL `{"N":"6"}` does not compare to `{"NS":["6", "2", "1"]}`. > <li> DCNL + `GT` : Greater than. AttributeValueList can contain only one DCNL AttributeValue element of type String, Number, or Binary (not a set DCNL type). If an item contains an AttributeValue element of a different DCNL type than the one specified in the request, the value does not DCNL match. For example, `{"S":"6"}` does not equal `{"N":"6"}`. Also, DCNL `{"N":"6"}` does not compare to `{"NS":["6", "2", "1"]}`. > <li> DCNL + `NOT_NULL` : The attribute exists. `NOT_NULL` is supported for all DCNL datatypes, including lists and maps. This operator tests for the DCNL existence of an attribute, not its data type. If the data type of DCNL attribute " `a`" is null, and you evaluate it using `NOT_NULL`, the DCNL result is a Boolean true . This result is because the attribute " DCNL `a`" exists; its data type is not relevant to the `NOT_NULL` DCNL comparison operator. DCNL + `NULL` : The attribute does not exist. `NULL` is supported for all DCNL datatypes, including lists and maps. This operator tests for the DCNL nonexistence of an attribute, not its data type. If the data type DCNL of attribute " `a`" is null, and you evaluate it using `NULL`, the DCNL result is a Boolean false . This is because the attribute " `a`" DCNL exists; its data type is not relevant to the `NULL` comparison DCNL operator. DCNL + `CONTAINS` : Checks for a subsequence, or value in a set. DCNL AttributeValueList can contain only one AttributeValue element of DCNL type String, Number, or Binary (not a set type). If the target DCNL attribute of the comparison is of type String, then the operator DCNL checks for a substring match. If the target attribute of the DCNL comparison is of type Binary, then the operator looks for a DCNL subsequence of the target that matches the input. If the target DCNL attribute of the comparison is a set (" `SS`", " `NS`", or " DCNL `BS`"), then the operator evaluates to true if it finds an exact DCNL match with any member of the set. CONTAINS is supported for lists: DCNL When evaluating " `a CONTAINS b`", " `a`" can be a list; however, " DCNL `b`" cannot be a set, a map, or a list. DCNL + `NOT_CONTAINS` : Checks for absence of a subsequence, or absence of a DCNL value in a set. AttributeValueList can contain only one DCNL AttributeValue element of type String, Number, or Binary (not a set DCNL type). If the target attribute of the comparison is a String, then DCNL the operator checks for the absence of a substring match. If the DCNL target attribute of the comparison is Binary, then the operator DCNL checks for the absence of a subsequence of the target that matches DCNL the input. If the target attribute of the comparison is a set (" DCNL `SS`", " `NS`", or " `BS`"), then the operator evaluates to true if DCNL it does not find an exact match with any member of the set. DCNL NOT_CONTAINS is supported for lists: When evaluating " `a NOT DCNL CONTAINS b`", " `a`" can be a list; however, " `b`" cannot be a DCNL set, a map, or a list. DCNL + `BEGINS_WITH` : Checks for a prefix. AttributeValueList can contain DCNL only one AttributeValue of type String or Binary (not a Number or a DCNL set type). The target attribute of the comparison must be of type DCNL String or Binary (not a Number or a set type). > <li> DCNL + `IN` : Checks for matching elements within two sets. DCNL AttributeValueList can contain one or more AttributeValue elements DCNL of type String, Number, or Binary (not a set type). These DCNL attributes are compared against an existing set type attribute of DCNL an item. If any elements of the input set are present in the item DCNL attribute, the expression evaluates to true. DCNL + `BETWEEN` : Greater than or equal to the first value, and less than DCNL or equal to the second value. AttributeValueList must contain two DCNL AttributeValue elements of the same type, either String, Number, or DCNL Binary (not a set type). A target attribute matches if the target DCNL value is greater than, or equal to, the first element and less DCNL than, or equal to, the second element. If an item contains an DCNL AttributeValue element of a different type than the one specified DCNL in the request, the value does not match. For example, `{"S":"6"}` DCNL does not compare to `{"N":"6"}`. Also, `{"N":"6"}` does not compare DCNL to `{"NS":["6", "2", "1"]}` DCNL For usage examples of AttributeValueList and ComparisonOperator , see DCNL `Legacy Conditional Parameters`_ in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer DCNL Guide . DCNL For backward compatibility with previous DynamoDB releases, the DCNL following parameters can be used instead of AttributeValueList and DCNL ComparisonOperator : DCNL + Value - A value for DynamoDB to compare with an attribute. DCNL + Exists - A Boolean value that causes DynamoDB to evaluate the value DCNL before attempting the conditional operation: DCNL + If Exists is `True`, DynamoDB will check to see if that attribute DCNL value already exists in the table. If it is found, then the DCNL condition evaluates to true; otherwise the condition evaluate to DCNL false. DCNL + If Exists is `False`, DynamoDB assumes that the attribute value does DCNL not exist in the table. If in fact the value does not exist, then DCNL the assumption is valid and the condition evaluates to true. If the DCNL value is found, despite the assumption that it does not exist, the DCNL condition evaluates to false. DCNL Note that the default value for Exists is `True`. DCNL The Value and Exists parameters are incompatible with DCNL AttributeValueList and ComparisonOperator . Note that if you use DCNL both sets of parameters at once, DynamoDB will return a DCNL ValidationException exception. DCNL :type conditional_operator: string DCNL :param conditional_operator: DCNL There is a newer parameter available. Use ConditionExpression instead. DCNL Note that if you use ConditionalOperator and ConditionExpression at DCNL the same time, DynamoDB will return a ValidationException DCNL exception. DCNL This parameter does not support lists or maps. DCNL A logical operator to apply to the conditions in the Expected map: DCNL + `AND` - If all of the conditions evaluate to true, then the entire DCNL map evaluates to true. DCNL + `OR` - If at least one of the conditions evaluate to true, then the DCNL entire map evaluates to true. DCNL If you omit ConditionalOperator , then `AND` is the default. DCNL The operation will succeed only if the entire map evaluates to true. DCNL :type return_values: string DCNL :param return_values: DCNL Use ReturnValues if you want to get the item attributes as they DCNL appeared either before or after they were updated. For UpdateItem , DCNL the valid values are: DCNL + `NONE` - If ReturnValues is not specified, or if its value is `NONE`, DCNL then nothing is returned. (This setting is the default for DCNL ReturnValues .) DCNL + `ALL_OLD` - If UpdateItem overwrote an attribute name-value pair, DCNL then the content of the old item is returned. DCNL + `UPDATED_OLD` - The old versions of only the updated attributes are DCNL returned. DCNL + `ALL_NEW` - All of the attributes of the new version of the item are DCNL returned. DCNL + `UPDATED_NEW` - The new versions of only the updated attributes are DCNL returned. DCNL :type return_consumed_capacity: string DCNL :param return_consumed_capacity: A value that if set to `TOTAL`, the DCNL response includes ConsumedCapacity data for tables and indexes. If DCNL set to `INDEXES`, the response includes ConsumedCapacity for DCNL indexes. If set to `NONE` (the default), ConsumedCapacity is not DCNL included in the response. DCNL :type return_item_collection_metrics: string DCNL :param return_item_collection_metrics: A value that if set to `SIZE`, DCNL the response includes statistics about item collections, if any, DCNL that were modified during the operation are returned in the DCNL response. If set to `NONE` (the default), no statistics are DCNL returned. DCNL :type update_expression: string DCNL :param update_expression: An expression that defines one or more DCNL attributes to be updated, the action to be performed on them, and DCNL new value(s) for them. DCNL The following action values are available for UpdateExpression . DCNL + `SET` - Adds one or more attributes and values to an item. If any of DCNL these attribute already exist, they are replaced by the new values. DCNL You can also use `SET` to add or subtract from an attribute that is DCNL of type Number. `SET` supports the following functions: DCNL + `if_not_exists (path, operand)` - if the item does not contain an DCNL attribute at the specified path, then `if_not_exists` evaluates to DCNL operand; otherwise, it evaluates to path. You can use this function DCNL to avoid overwriting an attribute that may already be present in DCNL the item. DCNL + `list_append (operand, operand)` - evaluates to a list with a new DCNL element added to it. You can append the new element to the start or DCNL the end of the list by reversing the order of the operands. DCNL These function names are case-sensitive. DCNL + `REMOVE` - Removes one or more attributes from an item. DCNL + `ADD` - Adds the specified value to the item, if the attribute does DCNL not already exist. If the attribute does exist, then the behavior DCNL of `ADD` depends on the data type of the attribute: DCNL + If the existing attribute is a number, and if Value is also a number, DCNL then Value is mathematically added to the existing attribute. If DCNL Value is a negative number, then it is subtracted from the existing DCNL attribute. If you use `ADD` to increment or decrement a number DCNL value for an item that doesn\'t exist before the update, DynamoDB DCNL uses `0` as the initial value. Similarly, if you use `ADD` for an DCNL existing item to increment or decrement an attribute value that DCNL doesn\'t exist before the update, DynamoDB uses `0` as the initial DCNL value. For example, suppose that the item you want to update DCNL doesn\'t have an attribute named itemcount , but you decide to `ADD` DCNL the number `3` to this attribute anyway. DynamoDB will create the DCNL itemcount attribute, set its initial value to `0`, and finally add DCNL `3` to it. The result will be a new itemcount attribute in the DCNL item, with a value of `3`. DCNL + If the existing data type is a set and if Value is also a set, then DCNL Value is added to the existing set. For example, if the attribute DCNL value is the set `[1,2]`, and the `ADD` action specified `[3]`, DCNL then the final attribute value is `[1,2,3]`. An error occurs if an DCNL `ADD` action is specified for a set attribute and the attribute DCNL type specified does not match the existing set type. Both sets must DCNL have the same primitive data type. For example, if the existing DCNL data type is a set of strings, the Value must also be a set of DCNL strings. DCNL The `ADD` action only supports Number and set data types. In addition, DCNL `ADD` can only be used on top-level attributes, not nested DCNL attributes. DCNL + `DELETE` - Deletes an element from a set. If a set of values is DCNL specified, then those values are subtracted from the old set. For DCNL example, if the attribute value was the set `[a,b,c]` and the DCNL `DELETE` action specifies `[a,c]`, then the final attribute value DCNL is `[b]`. Specifying an empty set is an error. The `DELETE` action DCNL only supports Number and set data types. In addition, `DELETE` can DCNL only be used on top-level attributes, not nested attributes. DCNL You can have many actions in a single expression, such as the DCNL following: `SET a=:value1, b=:value2 DELETE :value3, :value4, DCNL :value5` DCNL For more information on update expressions, go to `Modifying Items and DCNL Attributes`_ in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide . DCNL :type condition_expression: string DCNL :param condition_expression: A condition that must be satisfied in DCNL order for a conditional update to succeed. DCNL An expression can contain any of the following: DCNL + Boolean functions: `attribute_exists | attribute_not_exists | DCNL contains | begins_with` These function names are case-sensitive. DCNL + Comparison operators: ` = | <> | < | > | <= DCNL | >= | BETWEEN | IN` DCNL + Logical operators: `AND | OR | NOT` DCNL For more information on condition expressions, go to `Specifying DCNL Conditions`_ in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide . DCNL :type expression_attribute_names: map DCNL :param expression_attribute_names: One or more substitution tokens for DCNL simplifying complex expressions. The following are some use cases DCNL for using ExpressionAttributeNames : DCNL + To shorten an attribute name that is very long or unwieldy in an DCNL expression. DCNL + To create a placeholder for repeating occurrences of an attribute DCNL name in an expression. DCNL + To prevent special characters in an attribute name from being DCNL misinterpreted in an expression. DCNL Use the **#** character in an expression to dereference an attribute DCNL name. For example, consider the following expression: DCNL + `order.customerInfo.LastName = "Smith" OR order.customerInfo.LastName DCNL = "Jones"` DCNL Now suppose that you specified the following for DCNL ExpressionAttributeNames : DCNL + `{"#name":"order.customerInfo.LastName"}` DCNL The expression can now be simplified as follows: DCNL + `#name = "Smith" OR #name = "Jones"` DCNL For more information on expression attribute names, go to `Accessing DCNL Item Attributes`_ in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide . DCNL :type expression_attribute_values: map DCNL :param expression_attribute_values: One or more values that can be DCNL substituted in an expression. DCNL Use the **:** (colon) character in an expression to dereference an DCNL attribute value. For example, suppose that you wanted to check DCNL whether the value of the ProductStatus attribute was one of the DCNL following: DCNL `Available | Backordered | Discontinued` DCNL You would first need to specify ExpressionAttributeValues as follows: DCNL `{ ":avail":{"S":"Available"}, ":back":{"S":"Backordered"}, DCNL ":disc":{"S":"Discontinued"} }` DCNL You could then use these values in an expression, such as this: DCNL `ProductStatus IN (:avail, :back, :disc)` DCNL For more information on expression attribute values, go to `Specifying DCNL Conditions`_ in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide .'
'Updates the provisioned throughput for the given table, or DCNL manages the global secondary indexes on the table.

'Retrieves a list of documents that match the specified search DCNL criteria. How you specify the search criteria depends on which DCNL query parser you use. Amazon CloudSearch supports four query DCNL parsers: DCNL + `simple`: search all `text` and `text-array` fields for the DCNL specified string. Search for phrases, individual terms, and DCNL prefixes. DCNL + `structured`: search specific fields, construct compound DCNL queries using Boolean operators, and use advanced features DCNL such as term boosting and proximity searching. DCNL + `lucene`: specify search criteria using the Apache Lucene DCNL query parser syntax. DCNL + `dismax`: specify search criteria using the simplified DCNL subset of the Apache Lucene query parser syntax defined by the DCNL DisMax query parser. DCNL For more information, see `Searching Your Data`_ in the Amazon DCNL CloudSearch Developer Guide . DCNL The endpoint for submitting `Search` requests is domain- DCNL specific. You submit search requests to a domain\'s search DCNL endpoint. To get the search endpoint for your domain, use the DCNL Amazon CloudSearch configuration service `DescribeDomains` DCNL action. A domain\'s endpoints are also displayed on the domain DCNL dashboard in the Amazon CloudSearch console. DCNL :type cursor: string DCNL :param cursor: Retrieves a cursor value you can use to page through DCNL large result sets. Use the `size` parameter to control the number DCNL of hits to include in each response. You can specify either the DCNL `cursor` or `start` parameter in a request; they are mutually DCNL exclusive. To get the first cursor, set the cursor value to DCNL `initial`. In subsequent requests, specify the cursor value DCNL returned in the hits section of the response. DCNL For more information, see `Paginating Results`_ in the Amazon DCNL CloudSearch Developer Guide . DCNL :type expr: string DCNL :param expr: Defines one or more numeric expressions that can be used DCNL to sort results or specify search or filter criteria. You can also DCNL specify expressions as return fields. DCNL For more information about defining and using expressions, see DCNL `Configuring Expressions`_ in the Amazon CloudSearch Developer DCNL Guide . DCNL :type facet: string DCNL :param facet: Specifies one or more fields for which to get facet DCNL information, and options that control how the facet information is DCNL returned. Each specified field must be facet-enabled in the domain DCNL configuration. The fields and options are specified in JSON using DCNL the form `{"FIELD":{"OPTION":VALUE,"OPTION:"STRING"},"FIELD":{"OPTI DCNL ON":VALUE,"OPTION":"STRING"}}`. DCNL You can specify the following faceting options: DCNL + `buckets` specifies an array of the facet values or ranges to count. DCNL Ranges are specified using the same syntax that you use to search DCNL for a range of values. For more information, see ` Searching for a DCNL Range of Values`_ in the Amazon CloudSearch Developer Guide . DCNL Buckets are returned in the order they are specified in the DCNL request. The `sort` and `size` options are not valid if you specify DCNL `buckets`. DCNL + `size` specifies the maximum number of facets to include in the DCNL results. By default, Amazon CloudSearch returns counts for the top DCNL 10. The `size` parameter is only valid when you specify the `sort` DCNL option; it cannot be used in conjunction with `buckets`. DCNL + `sort` specifies how you want to sort the facets in the results: DCNL `bucket` or `count`. Specify `bucket` to sort alphabetically or DCNL numerically by facet value (in ascending order). Specify `count` to DCNL sort by the facet counts computed for each facet value (in DCNL descending order). To retrieve facet counts for particular values DCNL or ranges of values, use the `buckets` option instead of `sort`. DCNL If no facet options are specified, facet counts are computed for all DCNL field values, the facets are sorted by facet count, and the top 10 DCNL facets are returned in the results. DCNL For more information, see `Getting and Using Facet Information`_ in the DCNL Amazon CloudSearch Developer Guide . DCNL :type filter_query: string DCNL :param filter_query: Specifies a structured query that filters the DCNL results of a search without affecting how the results are scored DCNL and sorted. You use `filterQuery` in conjunction with the `query` DCNL parameter to filter the documents that match the constraints DCNL specified in the `query` parameter. Specifying a filter controls DCNL only which matching documents are included in the results, it has DCNL no effect on how they are scored and sorted. The `filterQuery` DCNL parameter supports the full structured query syntax. DCNL For more information about using filters, see `Filtering Matching DCNL Documents`_ in the Amazon CloudSearch Developer Guide . DCNL :type highlight: string DCNL :param highlight: Retrieves highlights for matches in the specified DCNL `text` or `text-array` fields. Each specified field must be DCNL highlight enabled in the domain configuration. The fields and DCNL options are specified in JSON using the form `{"FIELD":{"OPTION":VA DCNL LUE,"OPTION:"STRING"},"FIELD":{"OPTION":VALUE,"OPTION":"STRING"}}`. DCNL You can specify the following highlight options: DCNL + `format`: specifies the format of the data in the text field: `text` DCNL or `html`. When data is returned as HTML, all non-alphanumeric DCNL characters are encoded. The default is `html`. DCNL + `max_phrases`: specifies the maximum number of occurrences of the DCNL search term(s) you want to highlight. By default, the first DCNL occurrence is highlighted. DCNL + `pre_tag`: specifies the string to prepend to an occurrence of a DCNL search term. The default for HTML highlights is `<em>`. The DCNL default for text highlights is `*`. DCNL + `post_tag`: specifies the string to append to an occurrence of a DCNL search term. The default for HTML highlights is `</em>`. The DCNL default for text highlights is `*`. DCNL If no highlight options are specified for a field, the returned field DCNL text is treated as HTML and the first match is highlighted with DCNL emphasis tags: `<em>search-term</em>`. DCNL :type partial: boolean DCNL :param partial: Enables partial results to be returned if one or more DCNL index partitions are unavailable. When your search index is DCNL partitioned across multiple search instances, by default Amazon DCNL CloudSearch only returns results if every partition can be queried. DCNL This means that the failure of a single search instance can result DCNL in 5xx (internal server) errors. When you enable partial results, DCNL Amazon CloudSearch returns whatever results are available and DCNL includes the percentage of documents searched in the search results DCNL (percent-searched). This enables you to more gracefully degrade DCNL your users\' search experience. For example, rather than displaying DCNL no results, you could display the partial results and a message DCNL indicating that the results might be incomplete due to a temporary DCNL system outage. DCNL :type query: string DCNL :param query: Specifies the search criteria for the request. How you DCNL specify the search criteria depends on the query parser used for DCNL the request and the parser options specified in the `queryOptions` DCNL parameter. By default, the `simple` query parser is used to process DCNL requests. To use the `structured`, `lucene`, or `dismax` query DCNL parser, you must also specify the `queryParser` parameter. DCNL For more information about specifying search criteria, see `Searching DCNL Your Data`_ in the Amazon CloudSearch Developer Guide . DCNL :type query_options: string DCNL :param query_options: DCNL Configures options for the query parser specified in the `queryParser` DCNL parameter. DCNL The options you can configure vary according to which parser you use: DCNL + `defaultOperator`: The default operator used to combine individual DCNL terms in the search string. For example: `defaultOperator: \'or\'`. DCNL For the `dismax` parser, you specify a percentage that represents DCNL the percentage of terms in the search string (rounded down) that DCNL must match, rather than a default operator. A value of `0%` is the DCNL equivalent to OR, and a value of `100%` is equivalent to AND. The DCNL percentage must be specified as a value in the range 0-100 followed DCNL by the percent (%) symbol. For example, `defaultOperator: 50%`. DCNL Valid values: `and`, `or`, a percentage in the range 0%-100% ( DCNL `dismax`). Default: `and` ( `simple`, `structured`, `lucene`) or DCNL `100` ( `dismax`). Valid for: `simple`, `structured`, `lucene`, and DCNL `dismax`. DCNL + `fields`: An array of the fields to search when no fields are DCNL specified in a search. If no fields are specified in a search and DCNL this option is not specified, all text and text-array fields are DCNL searched. You can specify a weight for each field to control the DCNL relative importance of each field when Amazon CloudSearch DCNL calculates relevance scores. To specify a field weight, append a DCNL caret ( `^`) symbol and the weight to the field name. For example, DCNL to boost the importance of the `title` field over the `description` DCNL field you could specify: `"fields":["title^5","description"]`. DCNL Valid values: The name of any configured field and an optional DCNL numeric value greater than zero. Default: All `text` and `text- DCNL array` fields. Valid for: `simple`, `structured`, `lucene`, and DCNL `dismax`. DCNL + `operators`: An array of the operators or special characters you want DCNL to disable for the simple query parser. If you disable the `and`, DCNL `or`, or `not` operators, the corresponding operators ( `+`, `|`, DCNL `-`) have no special meaning and are dropped from the search DCNL string. Similarly, disabling `prefix` disables the wildcard DCNL operator ( `*`) and disabling `phrase` disables the ability to DCNL search for phrases by enclosing phrases in double quotes. Disabling DCNL precedence disables the ability to control order of precedence DCNL using parentheses. Disabling `near` disables the ability to use the DCNL ~ operator to perform a sloppy phrase search. Disabling the `fuzzy` DCNL operator disables the ability to use the ~ operator to perform a DCNL fuzzy search. `escape` disables the ability to use a backslash ( DCNL `\`) to escape special characters within the search string. DCNL Disabling whitespace is an advanced option that prevents the parser DCNL from tokenizing on whitespace, which can be useful for Vietnamese. DCNL (It prevents Vietnamese words from being split incorrectly.) For DCNL example, you could disable all operators other than the phrase DCNL operator to support just simple term and phrase queries: DCNL `"operators":["and","not","or", "prefix"]`. Valid values: `and`, DCNL `escape`, `fuzzy`, `near`, `not`, `or`, `phrase`, `precedence`, DCNL `prefix`, `whitespace`. Default: All operators and special DCNL characters are enabled. Valid for: `simple`. DCNL + `phraseFields`: An array of the `text` or `text-array` fields you DCNL want to use for phrase searches. When the terms in the search DCNL string appear in close proximity within a field, the field scores DCNL higher. You can specify a weight for each field to boost that DCNL score. The `phraseSlop` option controls how much the matches can DCNL deviate from the search string and still be boosted. To specify a DCNL field weight, append a caret ( `^`) symbol and the weight to the DCNL field name. For example, to boost phrase matches in the `title` DCNL field over the `abstract` field, you could specify: DCNL `"phraseFields":["title^3", "plot"]` Valid values: The name of any DCNL `text` or `text-array` field and an optional numeric value greater DCNL than zero. Default: No fields. If you don\'t specify any fields with DCNL `phraseFields`, proximity scoring is disabled even if `phraseSlop` DCNL is specified. Valid for: `dismax`. DCNL + `phraseSlop`: An integer value that specifies how much matches can DCNL deviate from the search phrase and still be boosted according to DCNL the weights specified in the `phraseFields` option; for example, DCNL `phraseSlop: 2`. You must also specify `phraseFields` to enable DCNL proximity scoring. Valid values: positive integers. Default: 0. DCNL Valid for: `dismax`. DCNL + `explicitPhraseSlop`: An integer value that specifies how much a DCNL match can deviate from the search phrase when the phrase is DCNL enclosed in double quotes in the search string. (Phrases that DCNL exceed this proximity distance are not considered a match.) For DCNL example, to specify a slop of three for dismax phrase queries, you DCNL would specify `"explicitPhraseSlop":3`. Valid values: positive DCNL integers. Default: 0. Valid for: `dismax`. DCNL + `tieBreaker`: When a term in the search string is found in a DCNL document\'s field, a score is calculated for that field based on how DCNL common the word is in that field compared to other documents. If DCNL the term occurs in multiple fields within a document, by default DCNL only the highest scoring field contributes to the document\'s DCNL overall score. You can specify a `tieBreaker` value to enable the DCNL matches in lower-scoring fields to contribute to the document\'s DCNL score. That way, if two documents have the same max field score for DCNL a particular term, the score for the document that has matches in DCNL more fields will be higher. The formula for calculating the score DCNL with a tieBreaker is `(max field score) + (tieBreaker) * (sum of DCNL the scores for the rest of the matching fields)`. Set `tieBreaker` DCNL to 0 to disregard all but the highest scoring field (pure max): DCNL `"tieBreaker":0`. Set to 1 to sum the scores from all fields (pure DCNL sum): `"tieBreaker":1`. Valid values: 0.0 to 1.0. Default: 0.0. DCNL Valid for: `dismax`. DCNL :type query_parser: string DCNL :param query_parser: DCNL Specifies which query parser to use to process the request. If DCNL `queryParser` is not specified, Amazon CloudSearch uses the DCNL `simple` query parser. DCNL Amazon CloudSearch supports four query parsers: DCNL + `simple`: perform simple searches of `text` and `text-array` fields. DCNL By default, the `simple` query parser searches all `text` and DCNL `text-array` fields. You can specify which fields to search by with DCNL the `queryOptions` parameter. If you prefix a search term with a DCNL plus sign (+) documents must contain the term to be considered a DCNL match. (This is the default, unless you configure the default DCNL operator with the `queryOptions` parameter.) You can use the `-` DCNL (NOT), `|` (OR), and `*` (wildcard) operators to exclude particular DCNL terms, find results that match any of the specified terms, or DCNL search for a prefix. To search for a phrase rather than individual DCNL terms, enclose the phrase in double quotes. For more information, DCNL see `Searching for Text`_ in the Amazon CloudSearch Developer Guide DCNL + `structured`: perform advanced searches by combining multiple DCNL expressions to define the search criteria. You can also search DCNL within particular fields, search for values and ranges of values, DCNL and use advanced options such as term boosting, `matchall`, and DCNL `near`. For more information, see `Constructing Compound Queries`_ DCNL in the Amazon CloudSearch Developer Guide . DCNL + `lucene`: search using the Apache Lucene query parser syntax. For DCNL more information, see `Apache Lucene Query Parser Syntax`_. DCNL + `dismax`: search using the simplified subset of the Apache Lucene DCNL query parser syntax defined by the DisMax query parser. For more DCNL information, see `DisMax Query Parser Syntax`_. DCNL :type ret: string DCNL :param ret: Specifies the field and expression values to include in DCNL the response. Multiple fields or expressions are specified as a DCNL comma-separated list. By default, a search response includes all DCNL return enabled fields ( `_all_fields`). To return only the document DCNL IDs for the matching documents, specify `_no_fields`. To retrieve DCNL the relevance score calculated for each document, specify `_score`. DCNL :type size: long DCNL :param size: Specifies the maximum number of search hits to include in DCNL the response. DCNL :type sort: string DCNL :param sort: Specifies the fields or custom expressions to use to sort DCNL the search results. Multiple fields or expressions are specified as DCNL a comma-separated list. You must specify the sort direction ( `asc` DCNL or `desc`) for each field; for example, `year desc,title asc`. To DCNL use a field to sort results, the field must be sort-enabled in the DCNL domain configuration. Array type fields cannot be used for sorting. DCNL If no `sort` parameter is specified, results are sorted by their DCNL default relevance scores in descending order: `_score desc`. You DCNL can also sort by document ID ( `_id asc`) and version ( `_version DCNL desc`). DCNL For more information, see `Sorting Results`_ in the Amazon CloudSearch DCNL Developer Guide . DCNL :type start: long DCNL :param start: Specifies the offset of the first search hit you want to DCNL return. Note that the result set is zero-based; the first result is DCNL at index 0. You can specify either the `start` or `cursor` DCNL parameter in a request, they are mutually exclusive. DCNL For more information, see `Paginating Results`_ in the Amazon DCNL CloudSearch Developer Guide .'

'Posts a batch of documents to a search domain for indexing. A DCNL document batch is a collection of add and delete operations DCNL that represent the documents you want to add, update, or DCNL delete from your domain. Batches can be described in either DCNL JSON or XML. Each item that you want Amazon CloudSearch to DCNL return as a search result (such as a product) is represented DCNL as a document. Every document has a unique ID and one or more DCNL fields that contain the data that you want to search and DCNL return in results. Individual documents cannot contain more DCNL than 1 MB of data. The entire batch cannot exceed 5 MB. To get DCNL the best possible upload performance, group add and delete DCNL operations in batches that are close the 5 MB limit.

'Returns a set of temporary security credentials (consisting of DCNL an access key ID, a secret access key, and a security token) DCNL for a federated user. A typical use is in a proxy application DCNL that is getting temporary security credentials on behalf of DCNL distributed applications inside a corporate network. Because DCNL you must call the `GetFederationToken` action using the long- DCNL term security credentials of an IAM user, this call is DCNL appropriate in contexts where those credentials can be safely DCNL stored, usually in a server-based application. DCNL **Note:** Do not use this call in mobile applications or DCNL client-based web applications that directly get temporary DCNL security credentials. For those types of applications, use DCNL `AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity`. DCNL The `GetFederationToken` action must be called by using the DCNL long-term AWS security credentials of the AWS account or an DCNL IAM user. Credentials that are created by IAM users are valid DCNL for the specified duration, between 900 seconds (15 minutes) DCNL and 129600 seconds (36 hours); credentials that are created by DCNL using account credentials have a maximum duration of 3600 DCNL seconds (1 hour).

'Returns a set of temporary security credentials (consisting of DCNL an access key ID, a secret access key, and a security token) DCNL that you can use to access AWS resources that you might not DCNL normally have access to. Typically, you use `AssumeRole` for DCNL cross-account access or federation. DCNL For cross-account access, imagine that you own multiple DCNL accounts and need to access resources in each account. You DCNL could create long-term credentials in each account to access DCNL those resources. However, managing all those credentials and DCNL remembering which one can access which account can be time DCNL consuming. Instead, you can create one set of long-term DCNL credentials in one account and then use temporary security DCNL credentials to access all the other accounts by assuming roles DCNL in those accounts. For more information about roles, see DCNL `Roles`_ in Using IAM . DCNL For federation, you can, for example, grant single sign-on DCNL access to the AWS Management Console. If you already have an DCNL identity and authentication system in your corporate network, DCNL you don\'t have to recreate user identities in AWS in order to DCNL grant those user identities access to AWS. Instead, after a DCNL user has been authenticated, you call `AssumeRole` (and DCNL specify the role with the appropriate permissions) to get DCNL temporary security credentials for that user. With those DCNL temporary security credentials, you construct a sign-in URL DCNL that users can use to access the console. For more DCNL information, see `Scenarios for Granting Temporary Access`_ in DCNL AWS Security Token Service . DCNL The temporary security credentials are valid for the duration DCNL that you specified when calling `AssumeRole`, which can be DCNL from 900 seconds (15 minutes) to 3600 seconds (1 hour).

'Decodes additional information about the authorization status DCNL of a request from an encoded message returned in response to DCNL an AWS request. DCNL For example, if a user is not authorized to perform an action DCNL that he or she has requested, the request returns a DCNL `Client.UnauthorizedOperation` response (an HTTP 403 DCNL response). Some AWS actions additionally return an encoded DCNL message that can provide details about this authorization DCNL failure. DCNL Only certain AWS actions return an encoded authorization DCNL message. The documentation for an individual action indicates DCNL whether that action returns an encoded message in addition to DCNL returning an HTTP code. DCNL The message is encoded because the details of the DCNL authorization status can constitute privileged information DCNL that the user who requested the action should not see.

'Creates a Amazon Kinesis stream. A stream captures and DCNL transports data records that are continuously emitted from DCNL different data sources or producers . Scale-out within an DCNL Amazon Kinesis stream is explicitly supported by means of DCNL shards, which are uniquely identified groups of data records DCNL in an Amazon Kinesis stream. DCNL You specify and control the number of shards that a stream is DCNL composed of. Each open shard can support up to 5 read DCNL transactions per second, up to a maximum total of 2 MB of data DCNL read per second. Each shard can support up to 1000 records DCNL written per second, up to a maximum total of 1 MB data written DCNL per second. You can add shards to a stream if the amount of DCNL data input increases and you can remove shards if the amount DCNL of data input decreases. DCNL The stream name identifies the stream. The name is scoped to DCNL the AWS account used by the application. It is also scoped by DCNL region. That is, two streams in two different accounts can DCNL have the same name, and two streams in the same account, but DCNL in two different regions, can have the same name. DCNL `CreateStream` is an asynchronous operation. Upon receiving a DCNL `CreateStream` request, Amazon Kinesis immediately returns and DCNL sets the stream status to `CREATING`. After the stream is DCNL created, Amazon Kinesis sets the stream status to `ACTIVE`. DCNL You should perform read and write operations only on an DCNL `ACTIVE` stream.

DCNL + Create more shards than are authorized for your account. DCNL The default limit for an AWS account is 10 shards per stream. DCNL If you need to create a stream with more than 10 shards, DCNL `contact AWS Support`_ to increase the limit on your account.

DCNL If you need to create a stream with more than 10 shards, `contact DCNL AWS Support`_ to increase the limit on your account.'
'Deletes a stream and all its shards and data. You must shut DCNL down any applications that are operating on the stream before DCNL you delete the stream. If an application attempts to operate DCNL on a deleted stream, it will receive the exception DCNL `ResourceNotFoundException`. DCNL If the stream is in the `ACTIVE` state, you can delete it. DCNL After a `DeleteStream` request, the specified stream is in the DCNL `DELETING` state until Amazon Kinesis completes the deletion.

'Describes the specified stream. DCNL The information about the stream includes its current status, DCNL its Amazon Resource Name (ARN), and an array of shard objects. DCNL For each shard object, there is information about the hash key DCNL and sequence number ranges that the shard spans, and the IDs DCNL of any earlier shards that played in a role in creating the DCNL shard. A sequence number is the identifier associated with DCNL every record ingested in the Amazon Kinesis stream. The DCNL sequence number is assigned when a record is put into the DCNL stream. DCNL You can limit the number of returned shards using the `Limit` DCNL parameter. The number of shards in a stream may be too large DCNL to return from a single call to `DescribeStream`. You can DCNL detect this by using the `HasMoreShards` flag in the returned DCNL output. `HasMoreShards` is set to `True` when there is more DCNL data available.

'Gets data records from a shard. DCNL Specify a shard iterator using the `ShardIterator` parameter. DCNL The shard iterator specifies the position in the shard from DCNL which you want to start reading data records sequentially. If DCNL there are no records available in the portion of the shard DCNL that the iterator points to, `GetRecords` returns an empty DCNL list. Note that it might take multiple calls to get to a DCNL portion of the shard that contains records. DCNL You can scale by provisioning multiple shards. Your DCNL application should have one thread per shard, each reading DCNL continuously from its stream. To read from a stream DCNL continually, call `GetRecords` in a loop. Use GetShardIterator DCNL to get the shard iterator to specify in the first `GetRecords` DCNL call. `GetRecords` returns a new shard iterator in DCNL `NextShardIterator`. Specify the shard iterator returned in DCNL `NextShardIterator` in subsequent calls to `GetRecords`. Note DCNL that if the shard has been closed, the shard iterator can\'t DCNL return more data and `GetRecords` returns `null` in DCNL `NextShardIterator`. You can terminate the loop when the shard DCNL is closed, or when the shard iterator reaches the record with DCNL the sequence number or other attribute that marks it as the DCNL last record to process. DCNL Each data record can be up to 50 KB in size, and each shard DCNL can read up to 2 MB per second. You can ensure that your calls DCNL don\'t exceed the maximum supported size or throughput by using DCNL the `Limit` parameter to specify the maximum number of records DCNL that `GetRecords` can return. Consider your average record DCNL size when determining this limit. For example, if your average DCNL record size is 40 KB, you can limit the data returned to about DCNL 1 MB per call by specifying 25 as the limit. DCNL The size of the data returned by `GetRecords` will vary DCNL depending on the utilization of the shard. The maximum size of DCNL data that `GetRecords` can return is 10 MB. If a call returns DCNL 10 MB of data, subsequent calls made within the next 5 seconds DCNL throw `ProvisionedThroughputExceededException`. If there is DCNL insufficient provisioned throughput on the shard, subsequent DCNL calls made within the next 1 second throw DCNL `ProvisionedThroughputExceededException`. Note that DCNL `GetRecords` won\'t return any data when it throws an DCNL exception. For this reason, we recommend that you wait one DCNL second between calls to `GetRecords`; however, it\'s possible DCNL that the application will get exceptions for longer than 1 DCNL second. DCNL To detect whether the application is falling behind in DCNL processing, add a timestamp to your records and note how long DCNL it takes to process them. You can also monitor how much data DCNL is in a stream using the CloudWatch metrics for write DCNL operations ( `PutRecord` and `PutRecords`). For more DCNL information, see `Monitoring Amazon Kinesis with Amazon DCNL CloudWatch`_ in the Amazon Kinesis Developer Guide .

'Gets a shard iterator. A shard iterator expires five minutes DCNL after it is returned to the requester. DCNL A shard iterator specifies the position in the shard from DCNL which to start reading data records sequentially. A shard DCNL iterator specifies this position using the sequence number of DCNL a data record in a shard. A sequence number is the identifier DCNL associated with every record ingested in the Amazon Kinesis DCNL stream. The sequence number is assigned when a record is put DCNL into the stream. DCNL You must specify the shard iterator type. For example, you can DCNL set the `ShardIteratorType` parameter to read exactly from the DCNL position denoted by a specific sequence number by using the DCNL `AT_SEQUENCE_NUMBER` shard iterator type, or right after the DCNL sequence number by using the `AFTER_SEQUENCE_NUMBER` shard DCNL iterator type, using sequence numbers returned by earlier DCNL calls to PutRecord, PutRecords, GetRecords, or DescribeStream. DCNL You can specify the shard iterator type `TRIM_HORIZON` in the DCNL request to cause `ShardIterator` to point to the last DCNL untrimmed record in the shard in the system, which is the DCNL oldest data record in the shard. Or you can point to just DCNL after the most recent record in the shard, by using the shard DCNL iterator type `LATEST`, so that you always read the most DCNL recent data in the shard. DCNL When you repeatedly read from an Amazon Kinesis stream use a DCNL GetShardIterator request to get the first shard iterator to to DCNL use in your first `GetRecords` request and then use the shard DCNL iterator returned by the `GetRecords` request in DCNL `NextShardIterator` for subsequent reads. A new shard iterator DCNL is returned by every `GetRecords` request in DCNL `NextShardIterator`, which you use in the `ShardIterator` DCNL parameter of the next `GetRecords` request. DCNL If a `GetShardIterator` request is made too often, you receive DCNL a `ProvisionedThroughputExceededException`. For more DCNL information about throughput limits, see GetRecords. DCNL If the shard is closed, the iterator can\'t return more data, DCNL and `GetShardIterator` returns `null` for its `ShardIterator`. DCNL A shard can be closed using SplitShard or MergeShards.

'Lists your streams. DCNL The number of streams may be too large to return from a single DCNL call to `ListStreams`. You can limit the number of returned DCNL streams using the `Limit` parameter. If you do not specify a DCNL value for the `Limit` parameter, Amazon Kinesis uses the DCNL default limit, which is currently 10. DCNL You can detect if there are more streams available to list by DCNL using the `HasMoreStreams` flag from the returned output. If DCNL there are more streams available, you can request more streams DCNL by using the name of the last stream returned by the DCNL `ListStreams` request in the `ExclusiveStartStreamName` DCNL parameter in a subsequent request to `ListStreams`. The group DCNL of stream names returned by the subsequent request is then DCNL added to the list. You can continue this process until all the DCNL stream names have been collected in the list.

'Merges two adjacent shards in a stream and combines them into DCNL a single shard to reduce the stream\'s capacity to ingest and DCNL transport data. Two shards are considered adjacent if the DCNL union of the hash key ranges for the two shards form a DCNL contiguous set with no gaps. For example, if you have two DCNL shards, one with a hash key range of 276...381 and the other DCNL with a hash key range of 382...454, then you could merge these DCNL two shards into a single shard that would have a hash key DCNL range of 276...454. After the merge, the single child shard DCNL receives data for all hash key values covered by the two DCNL parent shards. DCNL `MergeShards` is called when there is a need to reduce the DCNL overall capacity of a stream because of excess capacity that DCNL is not being used. You must specify the shard to be merged and DCNL the adjacent shard for a stream. For more information about DCNL merging shards, see `Merge Two Shards`_ in the Amazon Kinesis DCNL Developer Guide . DCNL If the stream is in the `ACTIVE` state, you can call DCNL `MergeShards`. If a stream is in the `CREATING`, `UPDATING`, DCNL or `DELETING` state, `MergeShards` returns a DCNL `ResourceInUseException`. If the specified stream does not DCNL exist, `MergeShards` returns a `ResourceNotFoundException`. DCNL You can use DescribeStream to check the state of the stream, DCNL which is returned in `StreamStatus`. DCNL `MergeShards` is an asynchronous operation. Upon receiving a DCNL `MergeShards` request, Amazon Kinesis immediately returns a DCNL response and sets the `StreamStatus` to `UPDATING`.

'This operation puts a data record into an Amazon Kinesis DCNL stream from a producer. This operation must be called to send DCNL data from the producer into the Amazon Kinesis stream for DCNL real-time ingestion and subsequent processing. The `PutRecord` DCNL operation requires the name of the stream that captures, DCNL stores, and transports the data; a partition key; and the data DCNL blob itself. The data blob could be a segment from a log file, DCNL geographic/location data, website clickstream data, or any DCNL other data type. DCNL The partition key is used to distribute data across shards. DCNL Amazon Kinesis segregates the data records that belong to a DCNL data stream into multiple shards, using the partition key DCNL associated with each data record to determine which shard a DCNL given data record belongs to. DCNL Partition keys are Unicode strings, with a maximum length DCNL limit of 256 bytes. An MD5 hash function is used to map DCNL partition keys to 128-bit integer values and to map associated DCNL data records to shards using the hash key ranges of the DCNL shards. You can override hashing the partition key to DCNL determine the shard by explicitly specifying a hash value DCNL using the `ExplicitHashKey` parameter. For more information, DCNL see the `Amazon Kinesis Developer Guide`_. DCNL `PutRecord` returns the shard ID of where the data record was DCNL placed and the sequence number that was assigned to the data DCNL record. DCNL Sequence numbers generally increase over time. To guarantee DCNL strictly increasing ordering, use the DCNL `SequenceNumberForOrdering` parameter. For more information, DCNL see the `Amazon Kinesis Developer Guide`_. DCNL If a `PutRecord` request cannot be processed because of DCNL insufficient provisioned throughput on the shard involved in DCNL the request, `PutRecord` throws DCNL `ProvisionedThroughputExceededException`.

'Puts (writes) multiple data records from a producer into an DCNL Amazon Kinesis stream in a single call (also referred to as a DCNL `PutRecords` request). Use this operation to send data from a DCNL data producer into the Amazon Kinesis stream for real-time DCNL ingestion and processing. Each shard can support up to 1000 DCNL records written per second, up to a maximum total of 1 MB data DCNL written per second. DCNL You must specify the name of the stream that captures, stores, DCNL and transports the data; and an array of request `Records`, DCNL with each record in the array requiring a partition key and DCNL data blob. DCNL The data blob can be any type of data; for example, a segment DCNL from a log file, geographic/location data, website clickstream DCNL data, and so on. DCNL The partition key is used by Amazon Kinesis as input to a hash DCNL function that maps the partition key and associated data to a DCNL specific shard. An MD5 hash function is used to map partition DCNL keys to 128-bit integer values and to map associated data DCNL records to shards. As a result of this hashing mechanism, all DCNL data records with the same partition key map to the same shard DCNL within the stream. For more information, see `Partition Key`_ DCNL in the Amazon Kinesis Developer Guide . DCNL Each record in the `Records` array may include an optional DCNL parameter, `ExplicitHashKey`, which overrides the partition DCNL key to shard mapping. This parameter allows a data producer to DCNL determine explicitly the shard where the record is stored. For DCNL more information, see `Adding Multiple Records with DCNL PutRecords`_ in the Amazon Kinesis Developer Guide . DCNL The `PutRecords` response includes an array of response DCNL `Records`. Each record in the response array directly DCNL correlates with a record in the request array using natural DCNL ordering, from the top to the bottom of the request and DCNL response. The response `Records` array always includes the DCNL same number of records as the request array. DCNL The response `Records` array includes both successfully and DCNL unsuccessfully processed records. Amazon Kinesis attempts to DCNL process all records in each `PutRecords` request. A single DCNL record failure does not stop the processing of subsequent DCNL records. DCNL A successfully-processed record includes `ShardId` and DCNL `SequenceNumber` values. The `ShardId` parameter identifies DCNL the shard in the stream where the record is stored. The DCNL `SequenceNumber` parameter is an identifier assigned to the DCNL put record, unique to all records in the stream. DCNL An unsuccessfully-processed record includes `ErrorCode` and DCNL `ErrorMessage` values. `ErrorCode` reflects the type of error DCNL and can be one of the following values: DCNL `ProvisionedThroughputExceededException` or `InternalFailure`. DCNL `ErrorMessage` provides more detailed information about the DCNL `ProvisionedThroughputExceededException` exception including DCNL the account ID, stream name, and shard ID of the record that DCNL was throttled.

'Splits a shard into two new shards in the stream, to increase DCNL the stream\'s capacity to ingest and transport data. DCNL `SplitShard` is called when there is a need to increase the DCNL overall capacity of stream because of an expected increase in DCNL the volume of data records being ingested. DCNL You can also use `SplitShard` when a shard appears to be DCNL approaching its maximum utilization, for example, when the set DCNL of producers sending data into the specific shard are suddenly DCNL sending more than previously anticipated. You can also call DCNL `SplitShard` to increase stream capacity, so that more Amazon DCNL Kinesis applications can simultaneously read data from the DCNL stream for real-time processing. DCNL You must specify the shard to be split and the new hash key, DCNL which is the position in the shard where the shard gets split DCNL in two. In many cases, the new hash key might simply be the DCNL average of the beginning and ending hash key, but it can be DCNL any hash key value in the range being mapped into the shard. DCNL For more information about splitting shards, see `Split a DCNL Shard`_ in the Amazon Kinesis Developer Guide . DCNL You can use DescribeStream to determine the shard ID and hash DCNL key values for the `ShardToSplit` and `NewStartingHashKey` DCNL parameters that are specified in the `SplitShard` request. DCNL `SplitShard` is an asynchronous operation. Upon receiving a DCNL `SplitShard` request, Amazon Kinesis immediately returns a DCNL response and sets the stream status to `UPDATING`. After the DCNL operation is completed, Amazon Kinesis sets the stream status DCNL to `ACTIVE`. Read and write operations continue to work while DCNL the stream is in the `UPDATING` state. DCNL You can use `DescribeStream` to check the status of the DCNL stream, which is returned in `StreamStatus`. If the stream is DCNL in the `ACTIVE` state, you can call `SplitShard`. If a stream DCNL is in `CREATING` or `UPDATING` or `DELETING` states, DCNL `DescribeStream` returns a `ResourceInUseException`. DCNL If the specified stream does not exist, `DescribeStream` DCNL returns a `ResourceNotFoundException`. If you try to create DCNL more shards than are authorized for your account, you receive DCNL a `LimitExceededException`. DCNL The default limit for an AWS account is 10 shards per stream. DCNL If you need to create a stream with more than 10 shards, DCNL `contact AWS Support`_ to increase the limit on your account. DCNL If you try to operate on too many streams in parallel using DCNL CreateStream, DeleteStream, MergeShards or SplitShard, you DCNL receive a `LimitExceededException`.

'This operation initiates a job of the specified type. In this DCNL release, you can initiate a job to retrieve either an archive DCNL or a vault inventory (a list of archives in a vault). DCNL Retrieving data from Amazon Glacier is a two-step process: DCNL #. Initiate a retrieval job. DCNL #. After the job completes, download the bytes. DCNL The retrieval request is executed asynchronously. When you DCNL initiate a retrieval job, Amazon Glacier creates a job and DCNL returns a job ID in the response. When Amazon Glacier DCNL completes the job, you can get the job output (archive or DCNL inventory data). For information about getting job output, see DCNL GetJobOutput operation. DCNL The job must complete before you can get its output. To DCNL determine when a job is complete, you have the following DCNL options: DCNL + **Use Amazon SNS Notification** You can specify an Amazon DCNL Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic to which Amazon DCNL Glacier can post a notification after the job is completed. DCNL You can specify an SNS topic per job request. The notification DCNL is sent only after Amazon Glacier completes the job. In DCNL addition to specifying an SNS topic per job request, you can DCNL configure vault notifications for a vault so that job DCNL notifications are always sent. For more information, see DCNL SetVaultNotifications. DCNL + **Get job details** You can make a DescribeJob request to DCNL obtain job status information while a job is in progress. DCNL However, it is more efficient to use an Amazon SNS DCNL notification to determine when a job is complete. DCNL The information you get via notification is same that you get DCNL by calling DescribeJob. DCNL If for a specific event, you add both the notification DCNL configuration on the vault and also specify an SNS topic in DCNL your initiate job request, Amazon Glacier sends both DCNL notifications.

However, AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) DCNL users don\'t have any permissions by default. You must grant DCNL them explicit permission to perform specific actions. For more DCNL information, see `Access Control Using AWS Identity and Access DCNL Management (IAM)`_. DCNL **About the Vault Inventory** DCNL Amazon Glacier prepares an inventory for each vault DCNL periodically, every 24 hours. When you initiate a job for a DCNL vault inventory, Amazon Glacier returns the last inventory for DCNL the vault. The inventory data you get might be up to a day or DCNL two days old. Also, the initiate inventory job might take some DCNL time to complete before you can download the vault inventory. DCNL So you do not want to retrieve a vault inventory for each DCNL vault operation. However, in some scenarios, you might find DCNL the vault inventory useful. For example, when you upload an DCNL archive, you can provide an archive description but not an DCNL archive name. Amazon Glacier provides you a unique archive ID, DCNL an opaque string of characters. So, you might maintain your DCNL own database that maps archive names to their corresponding DCNL Amazon Glacier assigned archive IDs. You might find the vault DCNL inventory useful in the event you need to reconcile DCNL information in your database with the actual vault inventory. DCNL **About Ranged Archive Retrieval** DCNL You can initiate an archive retrieval for the whole archive or DCNL a range of the archive. In the case of ranged archive DCNL retrieval, you specify a byte range to return or the whole DCNL archive. The range specified must be megabyte (MB) aligned, DCNL that is the range start value must be divisible by 1 MB and DCNL range end value plus 1 must be divisible by 1 MB or equal the DCNL end of the archive. If the ranged archive retrieval is not DCNL megabyte aligned, this operation returns a 400 response. DCNL Furthermore, to ensure you get checksum values for data you DCNL download using Get Job Output API, the range must be tree hash DCNL aligned.

DCNL If the job output is large, then you can use the `Range` DCNL request header to retrieve a portion of the output. This DCNL allows you to download the entire output in smaller chunks of DCNL bytes. For example, suppose you have 1 GB of job output you DCNL want to download and you decide to download 128 MB chunks of DCNL data at a time, which is a total of eight Get Job Output DCNL requests. You use the following process to download the job DCNL output: DCNL #. Download a 128 MB chunk of output by specifying the DCNL appropriate byte range using the `Range` header. DCNL #. Along with the data, the response includes a checksum of DCNL the payload.

'Include a configuration callable, to support imperative DCNL application extensibility. DCNL .. warning:: In versions of :app:`Pyramid` prior to 1.2, this DCNL function accepted ``*callables``, but this has been changed DCNL to support only a single callable. DCNL A configuration callable should be a callable that accepts a single DCNL argument named ``config``, which will be an instance of a DCNL :term:`Configurator`.  However, be warned that it will not be the same DCNL configurator instance on which you call this method.  The DCNL code which runs as a result of calling the callable should invoke DCNL methods on the configurator passed to it which add configuration DCNL state.  The return value of a callable will be ignored. DCNL Values allowed to be presented via the ``callable`` argument to DCNL this method: any callable Python object or any :term:`dotted Python DCNL name` which resolves to a callable Python object.  It may also be a DCNL Python :term:`module`, in which case, the module will be searched for DCNL a callable named ``includeme``, which will be treated as the DCNL configuration callable.

'Add a directive method to the configurator. DCNL .. warning:: This method is typically only used by :app:`Pyramid` DCNL framework extension authors, not by :app:`Pyramid` application DCNL developers.

This will make ``some.callable`` accessible as DCNL ``config.somename``.  ``some.callable`` should be a function which DCNL accepts ``config`` as a first argument, and arbitrary positional and DCNL keyword arguments following.  It should use config.action as DCNL necessary to perform actions.  Directive methods can then be invoked DCNL like \'built-in\' directives such as ``add_view``, ``add_route``, etc. DCNL The ``action_wrap`` argument should be ``True`` for directives which DCNL perform ``config.action`` with potentially conflicting DCNL discriminators.  ``action_wrap`` will cause the directive to be DCNL wrapped in a decorator which provides more accurate conflict DCNL cause information.

See the DCNL :term:`Venusian` documentation for more information about ``onerror`` DCNL callbacks. DCNL The ``ignore`` argument, if provided, should be a Venusian ``ignore`` DCNL value.  Providing an ``ignore`` argument allows the scan to ignore DCNL particular modules, packages, or global objects during a scan. DCNL ``ignore`` can be a string or a callable, or a list containing DCNL strings or callables.  The simplest usage of ``ignore`` is to provide DCNL a module or package by providing a full path to its dotted name.  For DCNL example: ``config.scan(ignore=\'my.module.subpackage\')`` would ignore DCNL the ``my.module.subpackage`` package during a scan, which would DCNL prevent the subpackage and any of its submodules from being imported DCNL and scanned.

'Add a :term:`route configuration` to the current DCNL configuration state, as well as possibly a :term:`view DCNL configuration` to be used to specify a :term:`view callable` DCNL that will be invoked when this route matches.  The arguments DCNL to this method are divided into *predicate*, *non-predicate*, DCNL and *view-related* types.  :term:`Route predicate` arguments DCNL narrow the circumstances in which a route will be match a DCNL request; non-predicate arguments are informational. DCNL Non-Predicate Arguments DCNL name DCNL The name of the route, e.g. ``myroute``.  This attribute is DCNL required.  It must be unique among all defined routes in a given DCNL application. DCNL factory DCNL A Python object (often a function or a class) or a :term:`dotted DCNL Python name` which refers to the same object that will generate a DCNL :app:`Pyramid` root resource object when this route matches. For DCNL example, ``mypackage.resources.MyFactory``.  If this argument is DCNL not specified, a default root factory will be used.  See DCNL :ref:`the_resource_tree` for more information about root factories. DCNL traverse DCNL If you would like to cause the :term:`context` to be DCNL something other than the :term:`root` object when this route DCNL matches, you can spell a traversal pattern as the DCNL ``traverse`` argument.  This traversal pattern will be used DCNL as the traversal path: traversal will begin at the root DCNL object implied by this route (either the global root, or the DCNL object returned by the ``factory`` associated with this DCNL route). DCNL The syntax of the ``traverse`` argument is the same as it is DCNL for ``pattern``. For example, if the ``pattern`` provided to DCNL ``add_route`` is ``articles/{article}/edit``, and the DCNL ``traverse`` argument provided to ``add_route`` is DCNL ``/{article}``, when a request comes in that causes the route DCNL to match in such a way that the ``article`` match value is DCNL ``\'1\'`` (when the request URI is ``/articles/1/edit``), the DCNL traversal path will be generated as ``/1``.  This means that DCNL the root object\'s ``__getitem__`` will be called with the DCNL name ``\'1\'`` during the traversal phase.  If the ``\'1\'`` object DCNL exists, it will become the :term:`context` of the request. DCNL :ref:`traversal_chapter` has more information about DCNL traversal. DCNL If the traversal path contains segment marker names which DCNL are not present in the ``pattern`` argument, a runtime error DCNL will occur.  The ``traverse`` pattern should not contain DCNL segment markers that do not exist in the ``pattern`` DCNL argument. DCNL A similar combining of routing and traversal is available DCNL when a route is matched which contains a ``*traverse`` DCNL remainder marker in its pattern (see DCNL :ref:`using_traverse_in_a_route_pattern`).  The ``traverse`` DCNL argument to add_route allows you to associate route patterns DCNL with an arbitrary traversal path without using a DCNL ``*traverse`` remainder marker; instead you can use other DCNL match information. DCNL Note that the ``traverse`` argument to ``add_route`` is DCNL ignored when attached to a route that has a ``*traverse`` DCNL remainder marker in its pattern. DCNL pregenerator DCNL This option should be a callable object that implements the DCNL :class:`pyramid.interfaces.IRoutePregenerator` interface.  A DCNL :term:`pregenerator` is a callable called by the DCNL :meth:`pyramid.request.Request.route_url` function to augment or DCNL replace the arguments it is passed when generating a URL for the DCNL route.  This is a feature not often used directly by applications, DCNL it is meant to be hooked by frameworks that use :app:`Pyramid` as DCNL a base. DCNL use_global_views DCNL When a request matches this route, and view lookup cannot DCNL find a view which has a ``route_name`` predicate argument DCNL that matches the route, try to fall back to using a view DCNL that otherwise matches the context, request, and view name DCNL (but which does not match the route_name predicate). DCNL static DCNL If ``static`` is ``True``, this route will never match an incoming DCNL request; it will only be useful for URL generation.  By default, DCNL ``static`` is ``False``.  See :ref:`static_route_narr`. DCNL .. versionadded:: 1.1 DCNL accept DCNL This value represents a match query for one or more mimetypes in the DCNL ``Accept`` HTTP request header.  If this value is specified, it must DCNL be in one of the following forms: a mimetype match token in the form DCNL ``text/plain``, a wildcard mimetype match token in the form DCNL ``text/*`` or a match-all wildcard mimetype match token in the form DCNL ``*/*``.  If any of the forms matches the ``Accept`` header of the DCNL request, or if the ``Accept`` header isn\'t set at all in the request, DCNL this will match the current route. If this does not match the DCNL ``Accept`` header of the request, route matching continues. DCNL Predicate Arguments DCNL pattern DCNL The pattern of the route e.g. ``ideas/{idea}``.  This DCNL argument is required.  See :ref:`route_pattern_syntax` DCNL for information about the syntax of route patterns.  If the DCNL pattern doesn\'t match the current URL, route matching DCNL continues. DCNL .. note:: DCNL For backwards compatibility purposes (as of :app:`Pyramid` 1.0), a DCNL ``path`` keyword argument passed to this function will be used to DCNL represent the pattern value if the ``pattern`` argument is DCNL ``None``.  If both ``path`` and ``pattern`` are passed, ``pattern`` DCNL wins. DCNL xhr DCNL This value should be either ``True`` or ``False``.  If this DCNL value is specified and is ``True``, the :term:`request` must DCNL possess an ``HTTP_X_REQUESTED_WITH`` (aka DCNL ``X-Requested-With``) header for this route to match.  This DCNL is useful for detecting AJAX requests issued from jQuery, DCNL Prototype and other Javascript libraries.  If this predicate DCNL returns ``False``, route matching continues. DCNL request_method DCNL A string representing an HTTP method name, e.g. ``GET``, ``POST``, DCNL ``HEAD``, ``DELETE``, ``PUT`` or a tuple of elements containing DCNL HTTP method names.  If this argument is not specified, this route DCNL will match if the request has *any* request method.  If this DCNL predicate returns ``False``, route matching continues. DCNL .. versionchanged:: 1.2 DCNL The ability to pass a tuple of items as ``request_method``. DCNL Previous versions allowed only a string. DCNL path_info DCNL This value represents a regular expression pattern that will DCNL be tested against the ``PATH_INFO`` WSGI environment DCNL variable.  If the regex matches, this predicate will return DCNL ``True``.  If this predicate returns ``False``, route DCNL matching continues. DCNL request_param DCNL This value can be any string.  A view declaration with this DCNL argument ensures that the associated route will only match DCNL when the request has a key in the ``request.params`` DCNL dictionary (an HTTP ``GET`` or ``POST`` variable) that has a DCNL name which matches the supplied value.  If the value DCNL supplied as the argument has a ``=`` sign in it, DCNL e.g. ``request_param="foo=123"``, then the key DCNL (``foo``) must both exist in the ``request.params`` dictionary, and DCNL the value must match the right hand side of the expression (``123``) DCNL for the route to "match" the current request.  If this predicate DCNL returns ``False``, route matching continues. DCNL header DCNL This argument represents an HTTP header name or a header DCNL name/value pair.  If the argument contains a ``:`` (colon), DCNL it will be considered a name/value pair DCNL (e.g. ``User-Agent:Mozilla/.*`` or ``Host:localhost``).  If DCNL the value contains a colon, the value portion should be a DCNL regular expression.  If the value does not contain a colon, DCNL the entire value will be considered to be the header name DCNL (e.g. ``If-Modified-Since``).  If the value evaluates to a DCNL header name only without a value, the header specified by DCNL the name must be present in the request for this predicate DCNL to be true.  If the value evaluates to a header name/value DCNL pair, the header specified by the name must be present in DCNL the request *and* the regular expression specified as the DCNL value must match the header value.  Whether or not the value DCNL represents a header name or a header name/value pair, the DCNL case of the header name is not significant.  If this DCNL predicate returns ``False``, route matching continues. DCNL effective_principals DCNL If specified, this value should be a :term:`principal` identifier or DCNL a sequence of principal identifiers.  If the DCNL :attr:`pyramid.request.Request.effective_principals` property DCNL indicates that every principal named in the argument list is present DCNL in the current request, this predicate will return True; otherwise it DCNL will return False.  For example: DCNL ``effective_principals=pyramid.security.Authenticated`` or DCNL ``effective_principals=(\'fred\', \'group:admins\')``. DCNL .. versionadded:: 1.4a4 DCNL custom_predicates DCNL .. deprecated:: 1.5 DCNL This value should be a sequence of references to custom DCNL predicate callables.  Use custom predicates when no set of DCNL predefined predicates does what you need.  Custom predicates DCNL can be combined with predefined predicates as necessary. DCNL Each custom predicate callable should accept two arguments: DCNL ``info`` and ``request`` and should return either ``True`` DCNL or ``False`` after doing arbitrary evaluation of the info DCNL and/or the request.  If all custom and non-custom predicate DCNL callables return ``True`` the associated route will be DCNL considered viable for a given request.  If any predicate DCNL callable returns ``False``, route matching continues.  Note DCNL that the value ``info`` passed to a custom route predicate DCNL is a dictionary containing matching information; see DCNL :ref:`custom_route_predicates` for more information about DCNL ``info``. DCNL predicates DCNL Pass a key/value pair here to use a third-party predicate DCNL registered via DCNL :meth:`pyramid.config.Configurator.add_route_predicate`.  More than DCNL one key/value pair can be used at the same time.  See DCNL :ref:`view_and_route_predicates` for more information about DCNL third-party predicates. DCNL .. versionadded:: 1.4'

'Return the :term:`routes mapper` object associated with DCNL this configurator\'s :term:`registry`.'
'.. versionadded:: 1.2 DCNL Add a \'tween factory\'.  A :term:`tween` (a contraction of \'between\') DCNL is a bit of code that sits between the Pyramid router\'s main request DCNL handling function and the upstream WSGI component that uses DCNL :app:`Pyramid` as its \'app\'.  Tweens are a feature that may be used DCNL by Pyramid framework extensions, to provide, for example, DCNL Pyramid-specific view timing support, bookkeeping code that examines DCNL exceptions before they are returned to the upstream WSGI application, DCNL or a variety of other features.  Tweens behave a bit like DCNL :term:`WSGI` \'middleware\' but they have the benefit of running in a DCNL context in which they have access to the Pyramid :term:`application DCNL registry` as well as the Pyramid rendering machinery. DCNL .. note:: You can view the tween ordering configured into a given DCNL Pyramid application by using the ``ptweens`` DCNL command.  See :ref:`displaying_tweens`. DCNL The ``tween_factory`` argument must be a :term:`dotted Python name` DCNL to a global object representing the tween factory. DCNL The ``under`` and ``over`` arguments allow the caller of DCNL ``add_tween`` to provide a hint about where in the tween chain this DCNL tween factory should be placed when an implicit tween chain is used. DCNL These hints are only used when an explicit tween chain is not used DCNL (when the ``pyramid.tweens`` configuration value is not set). DCNL Allowable values for ``under`` or ``over`` (or both) are: DCNL - ``None`` (the default). DCNL - A :term:`dotted Python name` to a tween factory: a string DCNL representing the dotted name of a tween factory added in a call to DCNL ``add_tween`` in the same configuration session. DCNL - One of the constants :attr:`pyramid.tweens.MAIN`, DCNL :attr:`pyramid.tweens.INGRESS`, or :attr:`pyramid.tweens.EXCVIEW`. DCNL - An iterable of any combination of the above. This allows the user DCNL to specify fallbacks if the desired tween is not included, as well DCNL as compatibility with multiple other tweens. DCNL ``under`` means \'closer to the main Pyramid application than\', DCNL ``over`` means \'closer to the request ingress than\'. DCNL For example, calling ``add_tween(\'myapp.tfactory\', DCNL over=pyramid.tweens.MAIN)`` will attempt to place the tween factory DCNL represented by the dotted name ``myapp.tfactory`` directly \'above\' DCNL (in ``ptweens`` order) the main Pyramid request handler. DCNL Likewise, calling ``add_tween(\'myapp.tfactory\', DCNL over=pyramid.tweens.MAIN, under=\'mypkg.someothertween\')`` will DCNL attempt to place this tween factory \'above\' the main handler but DCNL \'below\' (a fictional) \'mypkg.someothertween\' tween factory. DCNL If all options for ``under`` (or ``over``) cannot be found in the DCNL current configuration, it is an error. If some options are specified DCNL purely for compatibilty with other tweens, just add a fallback of DCNL MAIN or INGRESS. For example, ``under=(\'mypkg.someothertween\', DCNL \'mypkg.someothertween2\', INGRESS)``.  This constraint will require DCNL the tween to be located under both the \'mypkg.someothertween\' tween, DCNL the \'mypkg.someothertween2\' tween, and INGRESS. If any of these is DCNL not in the current configuration, this constraint will only organize DCNL itself based on the tweens that are present. DCNL Specifying neither ``over`` nor ``under`` is equivalent to specifying DCNL ``under=INGRESS``. DCNL Implicit tween ordering is obviously only best-effort.  Pyramid will DCNL attempt to present an implicit order of tweens as best it can, but DCNL the only surefire way to get any particular ordering is to use an DCNL explicit tween order.  A user may always override the implicit tween DCNL ordering by using an explicit ``pyramid.tweens`` configuration value DCNL setting. DCNL ``under``, and ``over`` arguments are ignored when an explicit tween DCNL chain is specified using the ``pyramid.tweens`` configuration value. DCNL For more information, see :ref:`registering_tweens`.'
'Add a :term:`view configuration` to the current DCNL configuration state.  Arguments to ``add_view`` are broken DCNL down below into *predicate* arguments and *non-predicate* DCNL arguments.  Predicate arguments narrow the circumstances in DCNL which the view callable will be invoked when a request is DCNL presented to :app:`Pyramid`; non-predicate arguments are DCNL informational. DCNL Non-Predicate Arguments DCNL view DCNL A :term:`view callable` or a :term:`dotted Python name` DCNL which refers to a view callable.  This argument is required DCNL unless a ``renderer`` argument also exists.  If a DCNL ``renderer`` argument is passed, and a ``view`` argument is DCNL not provided, the view callable defaults to a callable that DCNL returns an empty dictionary (see DCNL :ref:`views_which_use_a_renderer`). DCNL permission DCNL A :term:`permission` that the user must possess in order to invoke DCNL the :term:`view callable`.  See :ref:`view_security_section` for DCNL more information about view security and permissions.  This is DCNL often a string like ``view`` or ``edit``. DCNL If ``permission`` is omitted, a *default* permission may be used DCNL for this view registration if one was named as the DCNL :class:`pyramid.config.Configurator` constructor\'s DCNL ``default_permission`` argument, or if DCNL :meth:`pyramid.config.Configurator.set_default_permission` was used DCNL prior to this view registration.  Pass the value DCNL :data:`pyramid.security.NO_PERMISSION_REQUIRED` as the permission DCNL argument to explicitly indicate that the view should always be DCNL executable by entirely anonymous users, regardless of the default DCNL permission, bypassing any :term:`authorization policy` that may be DCNL in effect. DCNL attr DCNL This knob is most useful when the view definition is a class. DCNL The view machinery defaults to using the ``__call__`` method DCNL of the :term:`view callable` (or the function itself, if the DCNL view callable is a function) to obtain a response.  The DCNL ``attr`` value allows you to vary the method attribute used DCNL to obtain the response.  For example, if your view was a DCNL class, and the class has a method named ``index`` and you DCNL wanted to use this method instead of the class\' ``__call__`` DCNL method to return the response, you\'d say ``attr="index"`` in the DCNL view configuration for the view. DCNL renderer DCNL This is either a single string term (e.g. ``json``) or a DCNL string implying a path or :term:`asset specification` DCNL (e.g. ``templates/views.pt``) naming a :term:`renderer` DCNL implementation.  If the ``renderer`` value does not contain DCNL a dot ``.``, the specified string will be used to look up a DCNL renderer implementation, and that renderer implementation DCNL will be used to construct a response from the view return DCNL value.  If the ``renderer`` value contains a dot (``.``), DCNL the specified term will be treated as a path, and the DCNL filename extension of the last element in the path will be DCNL used to look up the renderer implementation, which will be DCNL passed the full path.  The renderer implementation will be DCNL used to construct a :term:`response` from the view return DCNL value. DCNL Note that if the view itself returns a :term:`response` (see DCNL :ref:`the_response`), the specified renderer implementation DCNL is never called. DCNL When the renderer is a path, although a path is usually just DCNL a simple relative pathname (e.g. ``templates/foo.pt``, DCNL implying that a template named "foo.pt" is in the DCNL "templates" directory relative to the directory of the DCNL current :term:`package` of the Configurator), a path can be DCNL absolute, starting with a slash on UNIX or a drive letter DCNL prefix on Windows.  The path can alternately be a DCNL :term:`asset specification` in the form DCNL ``some.dotted.package_name:relative/path``, making it DCNL possible to address template assets which live in a DCNL separate package. DCNL The ``renderer`` attribute is optional.  If it is not DCNL defined, the "null" renderer is assumed (no rendering is DCNL performed and the value is passed back to the upstream DCNL :app:`Pyramid` machinery unmodified). DCNL http_cache DCNL .. versionadded:: 1.1 DCNL When you supply an ``http_cache`` value to a view configuration, DCNL the ``Expires`` and ``Cache-Control`` headers of a response DCNL generated by the associated view callable are modified.  The value DCNL for ``http_cache`` may be one of the following: DCNL - A nonzero integer.  If it\'s a nonzero integer, it\'s treated as a DCNL number of seconds.  This number of seconds will be used to DCNL compute the ``Expires`` header and the ``Cache-Control: DCNL max-age`` parameter of responses to requests which call this view. DCNL For example: ``http_cache=3600`` instructs the requesting browser DCNL to \'cache this response for an hour, please\'. DCNL - A ``datetime.timedelta`` instance.  If it\'s a DCNL ``datetime.timedelta`` instance, it will be converted into a DCNL number of seconds, and that number of seconds will be used to DCNL compute the ``Expires`` header and the ``Cache-Control: DCNL max-age`` parameter of responses to requests which call this view. DCNL For example: ``http_cache=datetime.timedelta(days=1)`` instructs DCNL the requesting browser to \'cache this response for a day, please\'. DCNL - Zero (``0``).  If the value is zero, the ``Cache-Control`` and DCNL ``Expires`` headers present in all responses from this view will DCNL be composed such that client browser cache (and any intermediate DCNL caches) are instructed to never cache the response. DCNL - A two-tuple.  If it\'s a two tuple (e.g. ``http_cache=(1, DCNL {\'public\':True})``), the first value in the tuple may be a DCNL nonzero integer or a ``datetime.timedelta`` instance; in either DCNL case this value will be used as the number of seconds to cache DCNL the response.  The second value in the tuple must be a DCNL dictionary.  The values present in the dictionary will be used as DCNL input to the ``Cache-Control`` response header.  For example: DCNL ``http_cache=(3600, {\'public\':True})`` means \'cache for an hour, DCNL and add ``public`` to the Cache-Control header of the response\'. DCNL All keys and values supported by the DCNL ``webob.cachecontrol.CacheControl`` interface may be added to the DCNL dictionary.  Supplying ``{\'public\':True}`` is equivalent to DCNL calling ``response.cache_control.public = True``. DCNL Providing a non-tuple value as ``http_cache`` is equivalent to DCNL calling ``response.cache_expires(value)`` within your view\'s body. DCNL Providing a two-tuple value as ``http_cache`` is equivalent to DCNL calling ``response.cache_expires(value[0], **value[1])`` within your DCNL view\'s body. DCNL If you wish to avoid influencing, the ``Expires`` header, and DCNL instead wish to only influence ``Cache-Control`` headers, pass a DCNL tuple as ``http_cache`` with the first element of ``None``, e.g.: DCNL ``(None, {\'public\':True})``. DCNL If you wish to prevent a view that uses ``http_cache`` in its DCNL configuration from having its caching response headers changed by DCNL this machinery, set ``response.cache_control.prevent_auto = True`` DCNL before returning the response from the view.  This effectively DCNL disables any HTTP caching done by ``http_cache`` for that response. DCNL require_csrf DCNL .. versionadded:: 1.7 DCNL A boolean option or ``None``. Default: ``None``. DCNL If this option is set to ``True`` then CSRF checks will be enabled DCNL for requests to this view. The required token or header default to DCNL ``csrf_token`` and ``X-CSRF-Token``, respectively. DCNL CSRF checks only affect "unsafe" methods as defined by RFC2616. By DCNL default, these methods are anything except DCNL ``GET``, ``HEAD``, ``OPTIONS``, and ``TRACE``. DCNL The defaults here may be overridden by DCNL :meth:`pyramid.config.Configurator.set_default_csrf_options`. DCNL This feature requires a configured :term:`session factory`. DCNL If this option is set to ``False`` then CSRF checks will be disabled DCNL regardless of the default ``require_csrf`` setting passed DCNL to ``set_default_csrf_options``. DCNL See :ref:`auto_csrf_checking` for more information. DCNL wrapper DCNL The :term:`view name` of a different :term:`view DCNL configuration` which will receive the response body of this DCNL view as the ``request.wrapped_body`` attribute of its own DCNL :term:`request`, and the :term:`response` returned by this DCNL view as the ``request.wrapped_response`` attribute of its DCNL own request.  Using a wrapper makes it possible to "chain" DCNL views together to form a composite response.  The response DCNL of the outermost wrapper view will be returned to the user. DCNL The wrapper view will be found as any view is found: see DCNL :ref:`view_lookup`.  The "best" wrapper view will be found DCNL based on the lookup ordering: "under the hood" this wrapper DCNL view is looked up via DCNL ``pyramid.view.render_view_to_response(context, request, DCNL \'wrapper_viewname\')``. The context and request of a wrapper DCNL view is the same context and request of the inner view.  If DCNL this attribute is unspecified, no view wrapping is done. DCNL decorator DCNL A :term:`dotted Python name` to function (or the function itself, DCNL or an iterable of the aforementioned) which will be used to DCNL decorate the registered :term:`view callable`.  The decorator DCNL function(s) will be called with the view callable as a single DCNL argument.  The view callable it is passed will accept DCNL ``(context, request)``.  The decorator(s) must return a DCNL replacement view callable which also accepts ``(context, DCNL request)``. DCNL If decorator is an iterable, the callables will be combined and DCNL used in the order provided as a decorator. DCNL For example:: DCNL @view_config(..., DCNL decorator=(decorator2, DCNL decorator1)) DCNL def myview(request): DCNL Is similar to doing:: DCNL @view_config(...) DCNL @decorator2 DCNL @decorator1 DCNL def myview(request): DCNL Except with the existing benefits of ``decorator=`` (having a common DCNL decorator syntax for all view calling conventions and not having to DCNL think about preserving function attributes such as ``__name__`` and DCNL ``__module__`` within decorator logic). DCNL An important distinction is that each decorator will receive a DCNL response object implementing :class:`pyramid.interfaces.IResponse` DCNL instead of the raw value returned from the view callable. All DCNL decorators in the chain must return a response object or raise an DCNL exception: DCNL .. code-block:: python DCNL def log_timer(wrapped): DCNL def wrapper(context, request): DCNL start = time.time() DCNL response = wrapped(context, request) DCNL duration = time.time() - start DCNL response.headers[\'X-View-Time\'] = \'%.3f\' % (duration,) DCNL log.info(\'view took %.3f seconds\', duration) DCNL return response DCNL return wrapper DCNL .. versionchanged:: 1.4a4 DCNL Passing an iterable. DCNL mapper DCNL A Python object or :term:`dotted Python name` which refers to a DCNL :term:`view mapper`, or ``None``.  By default it is ``None``, which DCNL indicates that the view should use the default view mapper.  This DCNL plug-point is useful for Pyramid extension developers, but it\'s not DCNL very useful for \'civilians\' who are just developing stock Pyramid DCNL applications. Pay no attention to the man behind the curtain. DCNL accept DCNL This value represents a match query for one or more mimetypes in the DCNL ``Accept`` HTTP request header.  If this value is specified, it must DCNL be in one of the following forms: a mimetype match token in the form DCNL ``text/plain``, a wildcard mimetype match token in the form DCNL ``text/*`` or a match-all wildcard mimetype match token in the form DCNL ``*/*``.  If any of the forms matches the ``Accept`` header of the DCNL request, or if the ``Accept`` header isn\'t set at all in the request, DCNL this will match the current view. If this does not match the DCNL ``Accept`` header of the request, view matching continues. DCNL Predicate Arguments DCNL name DCNL The :term:`view name`.  Read :ref:`traversal_chapter` to DCNL understand the concept of a view name. DCNL context DCNL An object or a :term:`dotted Python name` referring to an DCNL interface or class object that the :term:`context` must be DCNL an instance of, *or* the :term:`interface` that the DCNL :term:`context` must provide in order for this view to be DCNL found and called.  This predicate is true when the DCNL :term:`context` is an instance of the represented class or DCNL if the :term:`context` provides the represented interface; DCNL it is otherwise false.  This argument may also be provided DCNL to ``add_view`` as ``for_`` (an older, still-supported DCNL spelling). If the view should *only* match when handling DCNL exceptions, then set the ``exception_only`` to ``True``. DCNL exception_only DCNL .. versionadded:: 1.8 DCNL When this value is ``True``, the ``context`` argument must be DCNL a subclass of ``Exception``. This flag indicates that only an DCNL :term:`exception view` should be created, and that this view should DCNL not match if the traversal :term:`context` matches the ``context`` DCNL argument. If the ``context`` is a subclass of ``Exception`` and DCNL this value is ``False`` (the default), then a view will be DCNL registered to match the traversal :term:`context` as well. DCNL route_name DCNL This value must match the ``name`` of a :term:`route DCNL configuration` declaration (see :ref:`urldispatch_chapter`) DCNL that must match before this view will be called. DCNL request_type DCNL This value should be an :term:`interface` that the DCNL :term:`request` must provide in order for this view to be DCNL found and called.  This value exists only for backwards DCNL compatibility purposes. DCNL request_method DCNL This value can be either a string (such as ``"GET"``, ``"POST"``, DCNL ``"PUT"``, ``"DELETE"``, ``"HEAD"`` or ``"OPTIONS"``) representing DCNL an HTTP ``REQUEST_METHOD``, or a tuple containing one or more of DCNL these strings.  A view declaration with this argument ensures that DCNL the view will only be called when the ``method`` attribute of the DCNL request (aka the ``REQUEST_METHOD`` of the WSGI environment) matches DCNL a supplied value.  Note that use of ``GET`` also implies that the DCNL view will respond to ``HEAD`` as of Pyramid 1.4. DCNL .. versionchanged:: 1.2 DCNL The ability to pass a tuple of items as ``request_method``. DCNL Previous versions allowed only a string. DCNL request_param DCNL This value can be any string or any sequence of strings.  A view DCNL declaration with this argument ensures that the view will only be DCNL called when the :term:`request` has a key in the ``request.params`` DCNL dictionary (an HTTP ``GET`` or ``POST`` variable) that has a DCNL name which matches the supplied value (if the value is a string) DCNL or values (if the value is a tuple).  If any value DCNL supplied has a ``=`` sign in it, DCNL e.g. ``request_param="foo=123"``, then the key (``foo``) DCNL must both exist in the ``request.params`` dictionary, *and* DCNL the value must match the right hand side of the expression DCNL (``123``) for the view to "match" the current request. DCNL match_param DCNL .. versionadded:: 1.2 DCNL This value can be a string of the format "key=value" or a tuple DCNL containing one or more of these strings. DCNL A view declaration with this argument ensures that the view will DCNL only be called when the :term:`request` has key/value pairs in its DCNL :term:`matchdict` that equal those supplied in the predicate. DCNL e.g. ``match_param="action=edit"`` would require the ``action`` DCNL parameter in the :term:`matchdict` match the right hand side of DCNL the expression (``edit``) for the view to "match" the current DCNL request. DCNL If the ``match_param`` is a tuple, every key/value pair must match DCNL for the predicate to pass. DCNL containment DCNL This value should be a Python class or :term:`interface` (or a DCNL :term:`dotted Python name`) that an object in the DCNL :term:`lineage` of the context must provide in order for this view DCNL to be found and called.  The nodes in your object graph must be DCNL "location-aware" to use this feature.  See DCNL :ref:`location_aware` for more information about DCNL location-awareness. DCNL xhr DCNL This value should be either ``True`` or ``False``.  If this DCNL value is specified and is ``True``, the :term:`request` DCNL must possess an ``HTTP_X_REQUESTED_WITH`` (aka DCNL ``X-Requested-With``) header that has the value DCNL ``XMLHttpRequest`` for this view to be found and called. DCNL This is useful for detecting AJAX requests issued from DCNL jQuery, Prototype and other Javascript libraries. DCNL header DCNL This value represents an HTTP header name or a header DCNL name/value pair.  If the value contains a ``:`` (colon), it DCNL will be considered a name/value pair DCNL (e.g. ``User-Agent:Mozilla/.*`` or ``Host:localhost``).  The DCNL value portion should be a regular expression.  If the value DCNL does not contain a colon, the entire value will be DCNL considered to be the header name DCNL (e.g. ``If-Modified-Since``).  If the value evaluates to a DCNL header name only without a value, the header specified by DCNL the name must be present in the request for this predicate DCNL to be true.  If the value evaluates to a header name/value DCNL pair, the header specified by the name must be present in DCNL the request *and* the regular expression specified as the DCNL value must match the header value.  Whether or not the value DCNL represents a header name or a header name/value pair, the DCNL case of the header name is not significant. DCNL path_info DCNL This value represents a regular expression pattern that will DCNL be tested against the ``PATH_INFO`` WSGI environment DCNL variable.  If the regex matches, this predicate will be DCNL ``True``. DCNL check_csrf DCNL .. deprecated:: 1.7 DCNL Use the ``require_csrf`` option or see :ref:`auto_csrf_checking` DCNL instead to have :class:`pyramid.exceptions.BadCSRFToken` DCNL exceptions raised. DCNL If specified, this value should be one of ``None``, ``True``, DCNL ``False``, or a string representing the \'check name\'.  If the value DCNL is ``True`` or a string, CSRF checking will be performed.  If the DCNL value is ``False`` or ``None``, CSRF checking will not be performed. DCNL If the value provided is a string, that string will be used as the DCNL \'check name\'.  If the value provided is ``True``, ``csrf_token`` will DCNL be used as the check name. DCNL If CSRF checking is performed, the checked value will be the value of DCNL ``request.params[check_name]``. This value will be compared against DCNL the value of ``policy.get_csrf_token()`` (where ``policy`` is an DCNL implementation of :meth:`pyramid.interfaces.ICSRFStoragePolicy`), and the DCNL check will pass if these two values are the same. If the check DCNL passes, the associated view will be permitted to execute. If the DCNL check fails, the associated view will not be permitted to execute. DCNL .. versionadded:: 1.4a2 DCNL .. versionchanged:: 1.9 DCNL This feature requires either a :term:`session factory` to have been DCNL configured, or a :term:`CSRF storage policy` other than the default DCNL to be in use. DCNL physical_path DCNL If specified, this value should be a string or a tuple representing DCNL the :term:`physical path` of the context found via traversal for this DCNL predicate to match as true.  For example: ``physical_path=\'/\'`` or DCNL ``physical_path=\'/a/b/c\'`` or ``physical_path=(\'\', \'a\', \'b\', \'c\')``. DCNL This is not a path prefix match or a regex, it\'s a whole-path match. DCNL It\'s useful when you want to always potentially show a view when some DCNL object is traversed to, but you can\'t be sure about what kind of DCNL object it will be, so you can\'t use the ``context`` predicate.  The DCNL individual path elements inbetween slash characters or in tuple DCNL elements should be the Unicode representation of the name of the DCNL resource and should not be encoded in any way. DCNL .. versionadded:: 1.4a3 DCNL effective_principals DCNL If specified, this value should be a :term:`principal` identifier or DCNL a sequence of principal identifiers.  If the DCNL :attr:`pyramid.request.Request.effective_principals` property DCNL indicates that every principal named in the argument list is present DCNL in the current request, this predicate will return True; otherwise it DCNL will return False.  For example: DCNL ``effective_principals=pyramid.security.Authenticated`` or DCNL ``effective_principals=(\'fred\', \'group:admins\')``. DCNL .. versionadded:: 1.4a4 DCNL custom_predicates DCNL .. deprecated:: 1.5 DCNL This value should be a sequence of references to custom DCNL predicate callables.  Use custom predicates when no set of DCNL predefined predicates do what you need.  Custom predicates DCNL can be combined with predefined predicates as necessary. DCNL Each custom predicate callable should accept two arguments: DCNL ``context`` and ``request`` and should return either DCNL ``True`` or ``False`` after doing arbitrary evaluation of DCNL the context and/or the request.  The ``predicates`` argument DCNL to this method and the ability to register third-party view DCNL predicates via DCNL :meth:`pyramid.config.Configurator.add_view_predicate` DCNL obsoletes this argument, but it is kept around for backwards DCNL compatibility. DCNL view_options DCNL Pass a key/value pair here to use a third-party predicate or set a DCNL value for a view deriver. See DCNL :meth:`pyramid.config.Configurator.add_view_predicate` and DCNL :meth:`pyramid.config.Configurator.add_view_deriver`. See DCNL :ref:`view_and_route_predicates` for more information about DCNL third-party predicates and :ref:`view_derivers` for information DCNL about view derivers. DCNL .. versionadded: 1.4a1 DCNL .. versionchanged: 1.7 DCNL Support setting view deriver options. Previously, only custom DCNL view predicate values could be supplied.'
'.. versionadded:: 1.4 DCNL Adds a view predicate factory.  The associated view predicate can DCNL later be named as a keyword argument to DCNL :meth:`pyramid.config.Configurator.add_view` in the DCNL ``predicates`` anonyous keyword argument dictionary. DCNL ``name`` should be the name of the predicate.  It must be a valid DCNL Python identifier (it will be used as a keyword argument to DCNL ``add_view`` by others). DCNL ``factory`` should be a :term:`predicate factory` or :term:`dotted DCNL Python name` which refers to a predicate factory. DCNL See :ref:`view_and_route_predicates` for more information.'
'.. versionadded:: 1.7 DCNL Add a :term:`view deriver` to the view pipeline. View derivers are DCNL a feature used by extension authors to wrap views in custom code DCNL controllable by view-specific options. DCNL ``deriver`` should be a callable conforming to the DCNL :class:`pyramid.interfaces.IViewDeriver` interface. DCNL ``name`` should be the name of the view deriver.  There are no DCNL restrictions on the name of a view deriver. If left unspecified, the DCNL name will be constructed from the name of the ``deriver``. DCNL The ``under`` and ``over`` options can be used to control the ordering DCNL of view derivers by providing hints about where in the view pipeline DCNL the deriver is used. Each option may be a string or a list of strings. DCNL At least one view deriver in each, the over and under directions, must DCNL exist to fully satisfy the constraints. DCNL ``under`` means closer to the user-defined :term:`view callable`, DCNL and ``over`` means closer to view pipeline ingress. DCNL The default value for ``over`` is ``rendered_view`` and ``under`` is DCNL ``decorated_view``. This places the deriver somewhere between the two DCNL in the view pipeline. If the deriver should be placed elsewhere in the DCNL pipeline, such as above ``decorated_view``, then you MUST also specify DCNL ``under`` to something earlier in the order, or a DCNL ``CyclicDependencyError`` will be raised when trying to sort the DCNL derivers.

'Create a :term:`view callable` using the function, instance, DCNL or class (or :term:`dotted Python name` referring to the same) DCNL provided as ``view`` object. DCNL .. warning:: DCNL This method is typically only used by :app:`Pyramid` framework DCNL extension authors, not by :app:`Pyramid` application developers. DCNL This is API is useful to framework extenders who create DCNL pluggable systems which need to register \'proxy\' view DCNL callables for functions, instances, or classes which meet the DCNL requirements of being a :app:`Pyramid` view callable.  For DCNL example, a ``some_other_framework`` function in another DCNL framework may want to allow a user to supply a view callable, DCNL but he may want to wrap the view callable in his own before DCNL registering the wrapper as a :app:`Pyramid` view callable. DCNL Because a :app:`Pyramid` view callable can be any of a DCNL number of valid objects, the framework extender will not know DCNL how to call the user-supplied object.  Running it through DCNL ``derive_view`` normalizes it to a callable which accepts two DCNL arguments: ``context`` and ``request``. DCNL For example: DCNL .. code-block:: python DCNL def some_other_framework(user_supplied_view): DCNL config = Configurator(reg) DCNL proxy_view = config.derive_view(user_supplied_view) DCNL def my_wrapper(context, request): DCNL do_something_that_mutates(request) DCNL return proxy_view(context, request) DCNL config.add_view(my_wrapper) DCNL The ``view`` object provided should be one of the following: DCNL - A function or another non-class callable object that accepts DCNL a :term:`request` as a single positional argument and which DCNL returns a :term:`response` object. DCNL - A function or other non-class callable object that accepts DCNL two positional arguments, ``context, request`` and which DCNL returns a :term:`response` object. DCNL - A class which accepts a single positional argument in its DCNL constructor named ``request``, and which has a ``__call__`` DCNL method that accepts no arguments that returns a DCNL :term:`response` object. DCNL - A class which accepts two positional arguments named DCNL ``context, request``, and which has a ``__call__`` method DCNL that accepts no arguments that returns a :term:`response` DCNL object. DCNL - A :term:`dotted Python name` which refers to any of the DCNL kinds of objects above. DCNL This API returns a callable which accepts the arguments DCNL ``context, request`` and which returns the result of calling DCNL the provided ``view`` object. DCNL The ``attr`` keyword argument is most useful when the view DCNL object is a class.  It names the method that should be used as DCNL the callable.  If ``attr`` is not provided, the attribute DCNL effectively defaults to ``__call__``.  See DCNL :ref:`class_as_view` for more information. DCNL The ``renderer`` keyword argument should be a renderer DCNL name. If supplied, it will cause the returned callable to use DCNL a :term:`renderer` to convert the user-supplied view result to DCNL a :term:`response` object.  If a ``renderer`` argument is not DCNL supplied, the user-supplied view must itself return a DCNL :term:`response` object.'

These DCNL argument values make no sense in the context of a Not Found View. DCNL If ``append_slash`` is ``True``, when this Not Found View is invoked, DCNL and the current path info does not end in a slash, the notfound logic DCNL will attempt to find a :term:`route` that matches the request\'s path DCNL info suffixed with a slash.  If such a route exists, Pyramid will DCNL issue a redirect to the URL implied by the route; if it does not, DCNL Pyramid will return the result of the view callable provided as DCNL ``view``, as normal. DCNL If the argument provided as ``append_slash`` is not a boolean but DCNL instead implements :class:`~pyramid.interfaces.IResponse`, the DCNL append_slash logic will behave as if ``append_slash=True`` was passed, DCNL but the provided class will be used as the response class instead of DCNL the default :class:`~pyramid.httpexceptions.HTTPFound` response class DCNL when a redirect is performed.  For example: DCNL .. code-block:: python DCNL from pyramid.httpexceptions import HTTPMovedPermanently DCNL config.add_notfound_view(append_slash=HTTPMovedPermanently) DCNL The above means that a redirect to a slash-appended route will be DCNL attempted, but instead of :class:`~pyramid.httpexceptions.HTTPFound` DCNL being used, :class:`~pyramid.httpexceptions.HTTPMovedPermanently will DCNL be used` for the redirect response if a slash-appended route is found.

'Add a view used to render static assets such as images DCNL and CSS files. DCNL The ``name`` argument is a string representing an DCNL application-relative local URL prefix.  It may alternately be a full DCNL URL. DCNL The ``path`` argument is the path on disk where the static files DCNL reside.  This can be an absolute path, a package-relative path, or a DCNL :term:`asset specification`. DCNL The ``cache_max_age`` keyword argument is input to set the DCNL ``Expires`` and ``Cache-Control`` headers for static assets served. DCNL Note that this argument has no effect when the ``name`` is a *url DCNL prefix*.  By default, this argument is ``None``, meaning that no DCNL particular Expires or Cache-Control headers are set in the response. DCNL The ``permission`` keyword argument is used to specify the DCNL :term:`permission` required by a user to execute the static view.  By DCNL default, it is the string DCNL :data:`pyramid.security.NO_PERMISSION_REQUIRED`, a special sentinel DCNL which indicates that, even if a :term:`default permission` exists for DCNL the current application, the static view should be renderered to DCNL completely anonymous users.  This default value is permissive DCNL because, in most web apps, static assets seldom need protection from DCNL viewing.  If ``permission`` is specified, the security checking will DCNL be performed against the default root factory ACL. DCNL Any other keyword arguments sent to ``add_static_view`` are passed on DCNL to :meth:`pyramid.config.Configurator.add_route` (e.g. ``factory``, DCNL perhaps to define a custom factory with a custom ACL for this static DCNL view). DCNL *Usage* DCNL The ``add_static_view`` function is typically used in conjunction DCNL with the :meth:`pyramid.request.Request.static_url` method. DCNL ``add_static_view`` adds a view which renders a static asset when DCNL some URL is visited; :meth:`pyramid.request.Request.static_url` DCNL generates a URL to that asset. DCNL The ``name`` argument to ``add_static_view`` is usually a simple URL DCNL prefix (e.g. ``\'images\'``).  When this is the case, the DCNL :meth:`pyramid.request.Request.static_url` API will generate a URL DCNL which points to a Pyramid view, which will serve up a set of assets DCNL that live in the package itself. For example: DCNL .. code-block:: python DCNL add_static_view(\'images\', \'mypackage:images/\') DCNL Code that registers such a view can generate URLs to the view via DCNL :meth:`pyramid.request.Request.static_url`: DCNL .. code-block:: python DCNL request.static_url(\'mypackage:images/logo.png\') DCNL When ``add_static_view`` is called with a ``name`` argument that DCNL represents a URL prefix, as it is above, subsequent calls to DCNL :meth:`pyramid.request.Request.static_url` with paths that start with DCNL the ``path`` argument passed to ``add_static_view`` will generate a DCNL URL something like ``http://<Pyramid app URL>/images/logo.png``, DCNL which will cause the ``logo.png`` file in the ``images`` subdirectory DCNL of the ``mypackage`` package to be served. DCNL ``add_static_view`` can alternately be used with a ``name`` argument DCNL which is a *URL*, causing static assets to be served from an external DCNL webserver.  This happens when the ``name`` argument is a fully DCNL qualified URL (e.g. starts with ``http://`` or similar).  In this DCNL mode, the ``name`` is used as the prefix of the full URL when DCNL generating a URL using :meth:`pyramid.request.Request.static_url`. DCNL Furthermore, if a protocol-relative URL (e.g. ``//example.com/images``) DCNL is used as the ``name`` argument, the generated URL will use the DCNL protocol of the request (http or https, respectively). DCNL For example, if ``add_static_view`` is called like so: DCNL .. code-block:: python DCNL add_static_view(\'http://example.com/images\', \'mypackage:images/\') DCNL Subsequently, the URLs generated by DCNL :meth:`pyramid.request.Request.static_url` for that static view will DCNL be prefixed with ``http://example.com/images`` (the external webserver DCNL listening on ``example.com`` must be itself configured to respond DCNL properly to such a request.): DCNL .. code-block:: python DCNL static_url(\'mypackage:images/logo.png\', request) DCNL See :ref:`static_assets_section` for more information.'
'Add a cache buster to a set of files on disk. DCNL The ``path`` should be the path on disk where the static files DCNL reside.  This can be an absolute path, a package-relative path, or a DCNL :term:`asset specification`.

See :ref:`cache_busting` for general information DCNL about cache busting. The value of the ``cachebust`` argument must DCNL be an object which implements DCNL :class:`~pyramid.interfaces.ICacheBuster`.

'The superdefault :term:`traversal` algorithm that :app:`Pyramid` uses DCNL is explained in :ref:`traversal_algorithm`.  Though it is rarely DCNL necessary, this default algorithm can be swapped out selectively for DCNL a different traversal pattern via configuration.  The section DCNL entitled :ref:`changing_the_traverser` details how to create a DCNL traverser class. DCNL For example, to override the superdefault traverser used by Pyramid, DCNL you might do something like this: DCNL .. code-block:: python DCNL from myapp.traversal import MyCustomTraverser DCNL config.add_traverser(MyCustomTraverser) DCNL This would cause the Pyramid superdefault traverser to never be used; DCNL instead all traversal would be done using your ``MyCustomTraverser`` DCNL class, no matter which object was returned by the :term:`root DCNL factory` of this application.  Note that we passed no arguments to DCNL the ``iface`` keyword parameter.  The default value of ``iface``, DCNL ``None`` represents that the registered traverser should be used when DCNL no other more specific traverser is available for the object returned DCNL by the root factory. DCNL However, more than one traversal algorithm can be active at the same DCNL time.  The traverser used can depend on the result of the :term:`root DCNL factory`.  For instance, if your root factory returns more than one DCNL type of object conditionally, you could claim that an alternate DCNL traverser adapter should be used against one particular class or DCNL interface returned by that root factory.  When the root factory DCNL returned an object that implemented that class or interface, a custom DCNL traverser would be used.  Otherwise, the default traverser would be DCNL used.  The ``iface`` argument represents the class of the object that DCNL the root factory might return or an :term:`interface` that the object DCNL might implement. DCNL To use a particular traverser only when the root factory returns a DCNL particular class: DCNL .. code-block:: python DCNL config.add_traverser(MyCustomTraverser, MyRootClass) DCNL When more than one traverser is active, the "most specific" traverser DCNL will be used (the one that matches the class or interface of the DCNL value returned by the root factory most closely). DCNL Note that either ``adapter`` or ``iface`` can be a :term:`dotted DCNL Python name` or a Python object. DCNL See :ref:`changing_the_traverser` for more information.'
'.. versionadded:: 1.3 DCNL When you add a traverser as described in DCNL :ref:`changing_the_traverser`, it\'s convenient to continue to use the DCNL :meth:`pyramid.request.Request.resource_url` API.  However, since the DCNL way traversal is done may have been modified, the URLs that DCNL ``resource_url`` generates by default may be incorrect when resources DCNL are returned by a custom traverser. DCNL If you\'ve added a traverser, you can change how DCNL :meth:`~pyramid.request.Request.resource_url` generates a URL for a DCNL specific type of resource by calling this method. DCNL The ``adapter`` argument represents a class that implements the DCNL :class:`~pyramid.interfaces.IResourceURL` interface.  The class DCNL constructor should accept two arguments in its constructor (the DCNL resource and the request) and the resulting instance should provide DCNL the attributes detailed in that interface (``virtual_path`` and DCNL ``physical_path``, in particular). DCNL The ``resource_iface`` argument represents a class or interface that DCNL the resource should possess for this url adapter to be used when DCNL :meth:`pyramid.request.Request.resource_url` looks up a resource url DCNL adapter.  If ``resource_iface`` is not passed, or it is passed as DCNL ``None``, the url adapter will be used for every type of resource. DCNL See :ref:`changing_resource_url` for more information.'

If a tuple is passed as a DCNL ``*remainder`` replacement value, its values are URL-quoted and DCNL encoded to UTF-8.  The resulting strings are joined with slashes DCNL and rendered into the URL.

DCNL If no ``_query`` keyword argument is provided, the request query string DCNL will be returned in the URL. If it is present, it will be used to DCNL compose a query string that will be tacked on to the end of the URL, DCNL replacing any request query string.  The value of ``_query`` may be a DCNL sequence of two-tuples *or* a data structure with an ``.items()`` DCNL method that returns a sequence of two-tuples (presumably a dictionary). DCNL This data structure will be turned into a query string per the DCNL documentation of :func:`pyramid.url.urlencode` function.

A DCNL non-``x-www-form-urlencoded`` query string may be used by passing a DCNL *string* value as ``_query`` in which case it will be URL-quoted DCNL (e.g. query="foo bar" will become "foo%20bar").  However, the result DCNL will not need to be in ``k=v`` form as required by DCNL ``x-www-form-urlencoded``.  After the query data is turned into a query DCNL string, a leading ``?`` is prepended, and the resulting string is DCNL appended to the generated URL. DCNL .. note:: DCNL Python data structures that are passed as ``_query`` which are DCNL sequences or dictionaries are turned into a string under the same DCNL rules as when run through :func:`urllib.urlencode` with the ``doseq`` DCNL argument equal to ``True``.  This means that sequences can be passed DCNL as values, and a k=v pair will be placed into the query string for DCNL each value. DCNL If a keyword argument ``_anchor`` is present, its string DCNL representation will be quoted per :rfc:`3986#section-3.5` and used as DCNL a named anchor in the generated URL DCNL (e.g. if ``_anchor`` is passed as ``foo`` and the route URL is DCNL ``http://example.com/route/url``, the resulting generated URL will DCNL be ``http://example.com/route/url#foo``). DCNL .. note:: DCNL If ``_anchor`` is passed as a string, it should be UTF-8 encoded. If DCNL ``_anchor`` is passed as a Unicode object, it will be converted to DCNL UTF-8 before being appended to the URL. DCNL If both ``_anchor`` and ``_query`` are specified, the anchor DCNL element will always follow the query element, DCNL e.g. ``http://example.com?foo=1#bar``. DCNL If any of the keyword arguments ``_scheme``, ``_host``, or ``_port`` DCNL is passed and is non-``None``, the provided value will replace the DCNL named portion in the generated URL.  For example, if you pass DCNL ``_host=\'foo.com\'``, and the URL that would have been generated DCNL without the host replacement is ``http://example.com/a``, the result DCNL will be ``http://foo.com/a``. DCNL Note that if ``_scheme`` is passed as ``https``, and ``_port`` is not DCNL passed, the ``_port`` value is assumed to have been passed as DCNL ``443``.  Likewise, if ``_scheme`` is passed as ``http`` and DCNL ``_port`` is not passed, the ``_port`` value is assumed to have been DCNL passed as ``80``. To avoid this behavior, always explicitly pass DCNL ``_port`` whenever you pass ``_scheme``. DCNL If a keyword ``_app_url`` is present, it will be used as the DCNL protocol/hostname/port/leading path prefix of the generated URL. DCNL For example, using an ``_app_url`` of DCNL ``http://example.com:8080/foo`` would cause the URL DCNL ``http://example.com:8080/foo/fleeb/flub`` to be returned from DCNL this function if the expansion of the route pattern associated DCNL with the ``route_name`` expanded to ``/fleeb/flub``.  If DCNL ``_app_url`` is not specified, the result of DCNL ``request.application_url`` will be used as the prefix (the DCNL default). DCNL If both ``_app_url`` and any of ``_scheme``, ``_host``, or ``_port`` DCNL are passed, ``_app_url`` takes precedence and any values passed for DCNL ``_scheme``, ``_host``, and ``_port`` will be ignored.

As a result, mutations performed to the DCNL ``request`` provided to a finished callback will have no DCNL meaningful effect, because response processing will have DCNL already occurred, and the request\'s scope will expire almost DCNL immediately after all finished callbacks have been processed. DCNL Errors raised by finished callbacks are not handled specially. DCNL They will be propagated to the caller of the :app:`Pyramid` DCNL router application.

Therefore, it\'s possible to use the DCNL ``request.response`` API to set up a response object with "the DCNL right" attributes (e.g. by calling ``request.response.set_cookie()``) DCNL within a view that uses a renderer.  Mutations to this response object DCNL will be preserved in the response sent to the client.'

'This integration test simulates the behavior of the domain layer DCNL prior to the introduction of a states schema. In particular, it deals DCNL with an exploration that was created before any states schema DCNL migrations occur. The exploration is constructed using multiple change DCNL lists, then a migration job is run. The test thereafter tests if DCNL reverting to a version prior to the migration still maintains a valid DCNL exploration. It tests both the exploration domain object and the DCNL exploration model stored in the datastore for validity. DCNL Note: It is important to distinguish between when the test is testing DCNL the exploration domain versus its model. It is operating at the domain DCNL layer when using exp_services.get_exploration_by_id. Otherwise, it DCNL loads the model explicitly using exp_models.ExplorationModel.get and DCNL then converts it to an exploration domain object for validation using DCNL exp_services.get_exploration_from_model. This is NOT the same process DCNL as exp_services.get_exploration_by_id as it skips many steps which DCNL include the conversion pipeline (which is crucial to this test).'
'This test attempts to load an exploration that is stored in the data DCNL store as pre-states schema version 0. The DCNL exp_services.get_exploration_by_id function should properly load and DCNL convert the exploration without any issues.

'Ellipses are normally drawn using an approximation that uses DCNL eight cubic bezier splines.  The error of this approximation DCNL is 1.89818e-6, according to this unverified source: DCNL Lancaster, Don.  Approximating a Circle or an Ellipse Using DCNL Four Bezier Cubic Splines. DCNL http://www.tinaja.com/glib/ellipse4.pdf DCNL There is a use case where very large ellipses must be drawn DCNL with very high accuracy, and it is too expensive to render the DCNL entire ellipse with enough segments (either splines or line DCNL segments).  Therefore, in the case where either radius of the DCNL ellipse is large enough that the error of the spline DCNL approximation will be visible (greater than one pixel offset DCNL from the ideal), a different technique is used. DCNL In that case, only the visible parts of the ellipse are drawn, DCNL with each visible arc using a fixed number of spline segments DCNL (8).  The algorithm proceeds as follows: DCNL 1. The points where the ellipse intersects the axes bounding DCNL box are located.  (This is done be performing an inverse DCNL transformation on the axes bbox such that it is relative DCNL to the unit circle -- this makes the intersection DCNL calculation much easier than doing rotated ellipse DCNL intersection directly). DCNL This uses the "line intersecting a circle" algorithm DCNL from: DCNL Vince, John.  Geometry for Computer Graphics: Formulae, DCNL Examples & Proofs.  London: Springer-Verlag, 2005. DCNL 2. The angles of each of the intersection points are DCNL calculated. DCNL 3. Proceeding counterclockwise starting in the positive DCNL x-direction, each of the visible arc-segments between the DCNL pairs of vertices are drawn using the bezier arc DCNL approximation technique implemented in DCNL :meth:`matplotlib.path.Path.arc`.'

'Define action to perform when successfully matching parse element definition. DCNL Parse action fn is a callable method with 0-3 arguments, called as fn(s,loc,toks), DCNL fn(loc,toks), fn(toks), or just fn(), where: DCNL - s   = the original string being parsed (see note below) DCNL - loc = the location of the matching substring DCNL - toks = a list of the matched tokens, packaged as a ParseResults object DCNL If the functions in fns modify the tokens, they can return them as the return DCNL value from fn, and the modified list of tokens will replace the original. DCNL Otherwise, fn does not need to return any value. DCNL Note: the default parsing behavior is to expand tabs in the input string DCNL before starting the parsing process.  See L{I{parseString}<parseString>} for more information DCNL on parsing strings containing <TAB>s, and suggested methods to maintain a DCNL consistent view of the parsed string, the parse location, and line and column DCNL positions within the parsed string.'

'Enables "packrat" parsing, which adds memoizing to the parsing logic. DCNL Repeated parse attempts at the same string location (which happens DCNL often in many complex grammars) can immediately return a cached value, DCNL instead of re-executing parsing/validating code.  Memoizing is done of DCNL both valid results and parsing exceptions. DCNL This speedup may break existing programs that use parse actions that DCNL have side-effects.  For this reason, packrat parsing is disabled when DCNL you first import pyparsing.  To activate the packrat feature, your DCNL program must call the class method ParserElement.enablePackrat().  If DCNL your program uses psyco to "compile as you go", you must call DCNL enablePackrat before calling psyco.full().  If you do not do this, DCNL Python will crash.  For best results, call enablePackrat() immediately DCNL after importing pyparsing.'

DCNL If you want the grammar to require that the entire input string be DCNL successfully parsed, then set parseAll to True (equivalent to ending DCNL the grammar with StringEnd()). DCNL Note: parseString implicitly calls expandtabs() on the input string, DCNL in order to report proper column numbers in parse actions. DCNL If the input string contains tabs and DCNL the grammar uses parse actions that use the loc argument to index into the DCNL string being parsed, you can ensure you have a consistent view of the input DCNL string by: DCNL - calling parseWithTabs on your grammar before calling parseString DCNL (see L{I{parseWithTabs}<parseWithTabs>}) DCNL - define your parse action using the full (s,loc,toks) signature, and DCNL reference the input string using the parse action\'s s argument DCNL - explictly expand the tabs in your input string before calling DCNL parseString'

In these situations, we update the hypersearch DCNL state regardless of the timestamp of the last time another DCNL worker updated it.'
'Find or create a candidate particle to produce a new model. DCNL At any one time, there is an active set of swarms in the current sprint, where DCNL each swarm in the sprint represents a particular combination of fields. DCNL Ideally, we should try to balance the number of models we have evaluated for DCNL each swarm at any time. DCNL This method will see how many models have been evaluated for each active DCNL swarm in the current active sprint(s) and then try and choose a particle DCNL from the least represented swarm in the first possible active sprint, with DCNL the following constraints/rules: DCNL for each active sprint: DCNL for each active swarm (preference to those with least# of models so far): DCNL 1.) The particle will be created from new (generation #0) if there are not DCNL already self._minParticlesPerSwarm particles in the swarm. DCNL 2.) Find the first gen that has a completed particle and evolve that DCNL particle to the next generation. DCNL 3.) If we got to here, we know that we have satisfied the min# of DCNL particles for the swarm, and they are all currently running (probably at DCNL various generation indexes). Go onto the next swarm DCNL If we couldn\'t find a swarm to allocate a particle in, go onto the next DCNL sprint and start allocating particles there.... DCNL Parameters: DCNL exhaustedSwarmId:   If not None, force a change to the current set of active DCNL swarms by marking this swarm as either \'completing\' or DCNL \'completed\'. If there are still models being evaluaed in DCNL it, mark it as \'completing\', else \'completed.

DCNL retval: (exit, particle, swarm) DCNL exit: If true, this worker is ready to exit (particle and DCNL swarm will be None) DCNL particle: Which particle to run DCNL swarm: which swarm the particle is in DCNL NOTE: When particle and swarm are None and exit is False, it DCNL means that we need to wait for one or more other worker(s) to DCNL finish their respective models before we can pick a particle DCNL to run.

'Test if it\'s OK to exit this worker. This is only called when we run DCNL out of prospective new models to evaluate. This method sees if all models DCNL have matured yet.

This gives this worker a chance to pick up and adopt any DCNL model which may become orphaned by another worker before it matures. DCNL If all models have matured, this method will send a STOP message to all DCNL matured, running models (presummably, there will be just one - the model DCNL which thinks it\'s the best) before returning True.'
'Create one or more new models for evaluation. These should NOT be models DCNL that we already know are in progress (i.e. those that have been sent to us DCNL via recordModelProgress). We return a list of models to the caller DCNL (HypersearchWorker) and if one can be successfully inserted into DCNL the models table (i.e. it is not a duplicate) then HypersearchWorker will DCNL turn around and call our runModel() method, passing in this model. If it DCNL is a duplicate, HypersearchWorker will call this method again. A model DCNL is a duplicate if either the  modelParamsHash or particleHash is DCNL identical to another entry in the model table. DCNL The numModels is provided by HypersearchWorker as a suggestion as to how DCNL many models to generate. This particular implementation only ever returns 1 DCNL model. DCNL Before choosing some new models, we first do a sweep for any models that DCNL may have been abandonded by failed workers. If/when we detect an abandoned DCNL model, we mark it as complete and orphaned and hide it from any subsequent DCNL queries to our ResultsDB. This effectively considers it as if it never DCNL existed. We also change the paramsHash and particleHash in the model record DCNL of the models table so that we can create another model with the same DCNL params and particle status and run it (which we then do immediately). DCNL The modelParamsHash returned for each model should be a hash (max allowed DCNL size of ClientJobsDAO.hashMaxSize) that uniquely identifies this model by DCNL it\'s params and the optional particleHash should be a hash of the particleId DCNL and generation index. Every model that gets placed into the models database, DCNL either by this worker or another worker, will have these hashes computed for DCNL it. The recordModelProgress gets called for every model in the database and DCNL the hash is used to tell which, if any, are the same as the ones this worker DCNL generated. DCNL NOTE: We check first ourselves for possible duplicates using the paramsHash DCNL before we return a model. If HypersearchWorker failed to insert it (because DCNL some other worker beat us to it), it will turn around and call our DCNL recordModelProgress with that other model so that we now know about it. It DCNL will then call createModels() again. DCNL This methods returns an exit boolean and the model to evaluate. If there is DCNL no model to evalulate, we may return False for exit because we want to stay DCNL alive for a while, waiting for all other models to finish. This gives us DCNL a chance to detect and pick up any possibly orphaned model by another DCNL worker. DCNL Parameters: DCNL numModels:   number of models to generate DCNL retval:      (exit, models) DCNL exit: true if this worker should exit. DCNL models: list of tuples, one for each model. Each tuple contains: DCNL (modelParams, modelParamsHash, particleHash) DCNL modelParams is a dictionary containing the following elements: DCNL structuredParams: dictionary containing all variables for DCNL this model, with encoders represented as a dict within DCNL this dict (or None if they are not included. DCNL particleState: dictionary containing the state of this DCNL particle. This includes the position and velocity of DCNL each of it\'s variables, the particleId, and the particle DCNL generation index. It contains the following keys: DCNL id: The particle Id of the particle we are using to DCNL generate/track this model. This is a string of the DCNL form <hypesearchWorkerId>.<particleIdx> DCNL genIdx: the particle\'s generation index. This starts at 0 DCNL and increments every time we move the particle to a DCNL new position. DCNL swarmId: The swarmId, which is a string of the form DCNL <encoder>.<encoder>... that describes this swarm DCNL varStates: dict of the variable states. The key is the DCNL variable name, the value is a dict of the variable\'s DCNL position, velocity, bestPosition, bestResult, etc.'

'The average number of columns per input, taking into account the topology DCNL of the inputs and columns. This value is used to calculate the inhibition DCNL radius.

'The range of connectedSynapses per column, averaged for each dimension. DCNL This value is used to calculate the inhibition radius.

'The primary method in charge of learning. Adapts the permanence values of DCNL the synapses based on the input vector, and the chosen columns after DCNL inhibition round. Permanence values are increased for synapses connected to DCNL input bits that are turned on, and decreased for synapses connected to DCNL inputs bits that are turned off. DCNL Parameters: DCNL :param inputVector: DCNL A numpy array of 0\'s and 1\'s that comprises the input to DCNL the spatial pooler. There exists an entry in the array DCNL for every input bit. DCNL :param activeColumns: DCNL An array containing the indices of the columns that DCNL survived inhibition.'
'This method increases the permanence values of synapses of columns whose DCNL activity level has been too low. Such columns are identified by having an DCNL overlap duty cycle that drops too much below those of their peers. The DCNL permanence values for such columns are increased.'
'This method ensures that each column has enough connections to input bits DCNL to allow it to become active. Since a column must have at least DCNL \'self._stimulusThreshold\' overlaps in order to be considered during the DCNL inhibition phase, columns without such minimal number of connections, even DCNL if all the input bits they are connected to turn on, have no chance of DCNL obtaining the minimum threshold. For such columns, the permanence values DCNL are increased until the minimum number of connections are formed. DCNL Parameters: DCNL :param perm:    An array of permanence values for a column. The array is DCNL "dense", i.e. it contains an entry for each input bit, even DCNL if the permanence value is 0. DCNL :param mask:    the indices of the columns whose permanences need to be DCNL raised.'
'This method updates the permanence matrix with a column\'s new permanence DCNL values. The column is identified by its index, which reflects the row in DCNL the matrix, and the permanence is given in \'dense\' form, i.e. a full DCNL array containing all the zeros as well as the non-zero values. It is in DCNL charge of implementing \'clipping\' - ensuring that the permanence values are DCNL always between 0 and 1 - and \'trimming\' - enforcing sparsity by zeroing out DCNL all permanence values below \'_synPermTrimThreshold\'. It also maintains DCNL the consistency between \'self._permanences\' (the matrix storing the DCNL permanence values), \'self._connectedSynapses\', (the matrix storing the bits DCNL each column is connected to), and \'self._connectedCounts\' (an array storing DCNL the number of input bits each column is connected to). Every method wishing DCNL to modify the permanence matrix should do so through this method. DCNL Parameters: DCNL :param perm:    An array of permanence values for a column. The array is DCNL "dense", i.e. it contains an entry for each input bit, even DCNL if the permanence value is 0. DCNL :param index:   The index identifying a column in the permanence, potential DCNL and connectivity matrices DCNL :param raisePerm: A boolean value indicating whether the permanence values DCNL should be raised until a minimum number are synapses are in DCNL a connected state. Should be set to \'false\' when a direct DCNL assignment is required.'
'Returns a randomly generated permanence value for a synapses that is DCNL initialized in a connected state. The basic idea here is to initialize DCNL permanence values very close to synPermConnected so that a small number of DCNL learning steps could make it disconnected or connected.

DCNL Parameters: DCNL :param potential: A numpy array specifying the potential pool of the column. DCNL Permanence values will only be generated for input bits DCNL corresponding to indices for which the mask value is 1.

Examples of the expected output of this method: DCNL * If the topology is one dimensional, and the column index is 0, this DCNL method will return the input index 0. If the column index is 1, and there DCNL are 3 columns over 7 inputs, this method will return the input index 3.

'Maps a column to its input bits. This method encapsulates the topology of DCNL the region. It takes the index of the column as an argument and determines DCNL what are the indices of the input vector that are located within the DCNL column\'s potential pool. The return value is a list containing the indices DCNL of the input bits. The current implementation of the base class only DCNL supports a 1 dimensional topology of columns with a 1 dimensional topology DCNL of inputs. To extend this class to support 2-D topology you will need to DCNL override this method. Examples of the expected output of this method: DCNL * If the potentialRadius is greater than or equal to the largest input DCNL dimension then each column connects to all of the inputs. DCNL * If the topology is one dimensional, the input space is divided up evenly DCNL among the columns and each column is centered over its share of the DCNL inputs.  If the potentialRadius is 5, then each column connects to the DCNL input it is centered above as well as the 5 inputs to the left of that DCNL input and the five inputs to the right of that input, wrapping around if DCNL wrapAround=True. DCNL * If the topology is two dimensional, the input space is again divided up DCNL evenly among the columns and each column is centered above its share of DCNL the inputs.  If the potentialRadius is 5, the column connects to a square DCNL that has 11 inputs on a side and is centered on the input that the column DCNL is centered above.

The boosting function is a curve defined as: DCNL boostFactors = exp[ - boostStrength * (dutyCycle - targetDensity)] DCNL Intuitively this means that columns that have been active at the target DCNL activation level have a boost factor of 1, meaning their overlap is not DCNL boosted. Columns whose active duty cycle drops too much below that of their DCNL neighbors are boosted depending on how infrequently they have been active. DCNL Columns that has been active more than the target activation level have DCNL a boost factor below 1, meaning their overlap is suppressed DCNL The boostFactor depends on the activeDutyCycle via an exponential function: DCNL boostFactor DCNL |                |           1  _  |                  |    _ DCNL +--------------------> activeDutyCycle DCNL targetDensity'

DCNL This will adjust @ref infActiveState[\'t\'] if it does manage to lock on to a DCNL sequence that started earlier. It will also compute infPredictedState[\'t\'] DCNL based on the possibly updated @ref infActiveState[\'t\'], so there is no need to DCNL call inferPhase2() after calling inferBacktrack(). DCNL This looks at: DCNL - ``infActiveState[\'t\']`` DCNL This updates/modifies: DCNL - ``infActiveState[\'t\']`` DCNL - ``infPredictedState[\'t\']`` DCNL - ``colConfidence[\'t\']`` DCNL - ``cellConfidence[\'t\']`` DCNL How it works: DCNL This method gets called from :meth:`updateInferenceState` when we detect DCNL either of the following two conditions: DCNL #. The current bottom-up input had too many un-expected columns DCNL #. We fail to generate a sufficient number of predicted columns for the DCNL next time step. DCNL Either of these two conditions indicate that we have fallen out of a DCNL learned sequence. DCNL Rather than simply "giving up" and bursting on the unexpected input DCNL columns, a better approach is to see if perhaps we are in a sequence that DCNL started a few steps ago. The real world analogy is that you are driving DCNL along and suddenly hit a dead-end, you will typically go back a few turns DCNL ago and pick up again from a familiar intersection. DCNL This back-tracking goes hand in hand with our learning methodology, which DCNL always tries to learn again from start cells after it loses context. This DCNL results in a network that has learned multiple, overlapping paths through DCNL the input data, each starting at different points. The lower the global DCNL decay and the more repeatability in the data, the longer each of these DCNL paths will end up being. DCNL The goal of this function is to find out which starting point in the past DCNL leads to the current input with the most context as possible. This gives us DCNL the best chance of predicting accurately going forward. Consider the DCNL following example, where you have learned the following sub-sequences which DCNL have the given frequencies: DCNL ? - Q - C - D - E      10X      seq 0 DCNL ? - B - C - D - F      1X       seq 1 DCNL ? - B - C - H - I      2X       seq 2 DCNL ? - B - C - D - F      3X       seq 3 DCNL ? - Z - A - B - C - D - J      2X       seq 4 DCNL ? - Z - A - B - C - H - I      1X       seq 5 DCNL ? - Y - A - B - C - D - F      3X       seq 6 DCNL W - X - Z - A - B - C - D          <= input history DCNL current time step DCNL Suppose, in the current time step, the input pattern is D and you have not DCNL predicted D, so you need to backtrack. Suppose we can backtrack up to 6 DCNL steps in the past, which path should we choose? From the table above, we can DCNL see that the correct answer is to assume we are in seq 4. How do we DCNL implement the backtrack to give us this right answer? The current DCNL implementation takes the following approach: DCNL #. Start from the farthest point in the past. DCNL #. For each starting point S, calculate the confidence of the current DCNL input, conf(startingPoint=S), assuming we followed that sequence. DCNL Note that we must have learned at least one sequence that starts at DCNL point S. DCNL #. If conf(startingPoint=S) is significantly different from DCNL conf(startingPoint=S-1), then choose S-1 as the starting point. DCNL The assumption here is that starting point S-1 is the starting point of DCNL a learned sub-sequence that includes the current input in it\'s path and DCNL that started the longest ago. It thus has the most context and will be DCNL the best predictor going forward. DCNL From the statistics in the above table, we can compute what the confidences DCNL will be for each possible starting point: DCNL startingPoint           confidence of D DCNL B (t-2)               4/6  = 0.667   (seq 1,3)/(seq 1,2,3) DCNL Z (t-4)               2/3  = 0.667   (seq 4)/(seq 4,5) DCNL First of all, we do not compute any confidences at starting points t-1, t-3, DCNL t-5, t-6 because there are no learned sequences that start at those points. DCNL Notice here that Z is the starting point of the longest sub-sequence leading DCNL up to the current input. Event though starting at t-2 and starting at t-4 DCNL give the same confidence value, we choose the sequence starting at t-4 DCNL because it gives the most context, and it mirrors the way that learning DCNL extends sequences.
